# Scraper Development Guide

## Goal

This library has the goals of

* making recipe information **accessible**,
* ensuring the author is **attributed** correctly,
* representing the recipes **accurately** and **authentically**

Sometimes it is simple and straightforward to achieve all these goals, and sometimes it is more difficult (which is why this library exists). Where some interpretation or creativity is required to scrape a recipe, we should always keep those goals in mind. Occasionally, that might mean that we can't support a particular website.
