# Scraper Development Guide

## Goal

The goals of this library are

* making recipe information **accessible**,
* ensuring the author is **attributed** correctly,
* representing recipes **accurately** and **authentically**

Sometimes it is simple and straightforward to achieve all these goals, while other times it is more difficult (which is why this library exists). When some interpretation or creativity is required to scrape a recipe, we should always keep these goals in mind. Occasionally, this might mean that we can't support a particular website.
