    This site keeps documentation for each release. To view the supported sites for a specific
    version, change the URL to include it, for example
    `/15.8.0/getting-started/supported-sites/`.

```python exec="on"
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '.')
from recipe_scrapers import SCRAPERS

sites = sorted(SCRAPERS.keys())

print(f"## What we offer?")
print(f"We currently support over **{len(sites)} popular recipe websites** out of the box! And with our `wild_mode` option, you can potentially scrape many more sites that follow common patterns - making this probably the most extensive recipe scraping library available.\n")
print(f"## Supported Sites List\n")
print("\n".join(f"- [{host}](https://{host}/)" for host in sites))
```
