Requests: <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2007/12/robert-linxes-chocolate-truffles/">Chocolate</a>. <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2007/07/you-are-owed-chocolate-cake/">Chocolate with chocolate</a>. <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2006/08/no-teddy-bear-guts-no-glory/">Chocolate with caramel</a>.

<p>What, can you sense a theme or something?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/2749896626/" title="cake batter"><img src="smittenkitchen_files/2749896626_91c8a5db36.jpg" alt="cake batter" height="332" width="500"></a></p>
<p>This year we added one more to the chocolate cake pile: Chocolate 
Peanut Butter Cake. Well, actually, the technical title of the cake is 
Sour Cream-Chocolate Cake with Peanut Butter Frosting and Chocolate 
Peanut Butter Glaze, though it is actually a Sour Cream-Chocolate Cake 
with <i>Cream Cheese</i> Peanut Butter Frosting and Chocolate Peanut 
Butter Glaze, but all you really need to know is that if you know a 
chocolate-and-peanut-butter lover, <i>you must make this cake</i>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/2749903434/" title="peanut butter cream cheese frosting"><img src="smittenkitchen_files/2749903434_db5329629b.jpg" alt="peanut butter cream cheese frosting" height="332" width="500"></a></p>
<p>Because did I mention the chocolate cake? With the chocolate-peanut 
butter ganache (I bet you didn’t even know such a thing existed, I sure 
didn’t and my life may never be the same again. I wish I could quit it.)
 And the cream cheese peanut butter frosting and filling? Actually, let 
us pause on that last part. If you’re anything like me, the thought of 
cream cheese and peanut butter intentionally mixed probably gives you a 
bit of pause. I don’t know cheese + sweetened peanuts? That can’t be 
right, I thought. Well, I was wrong. They are <i>perfect</i> together, with the tangy/saltiness of the cream cheese helping the peanut butter hit all the right notes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/2749070877/" title="peanut butter filling"><img src="smittenkitchen_files/2749070877_a0abd8ea94.jpg" alt="peanut butter filling" height="332" width="500"></a></p>
<p>You might be noticing a recurring theme here this summer, but what can I say? I’m in love with this book. I brought up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0811854485?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=smitten-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0811854485">Sky High</a> for the first time after making my own birthday cake this year, that glorious <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2008/06/pistachio-petit-four-cake/">Pistachio Petit-Four Cake</a>. You heard me yammer about this book again when we were in the midst of <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2008/07/project-wedding-cake-the-cake-is-baked/">Project Wedding Cake</a>, where both the vanilla and chocolate cake recipes were from this wonderful book. And here we are at it again.</p>

<p>If you like baking cakes, especially celebration cakes, you really 
want to get this book. What drew me to it was that the cakes are so 
interesting–no plain chocolate with vanilla frosting here but 
petit-fours and blue cornmeal with caramel cream and gingerbread beer 
with bittersweet chocolate and bananas with praline and white chocolate.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/2749081117/" title="chocolate peanut butter birthday cake"><img src="smittenkitchen_files/2749081117_4447fe0736.jpg" alt="chocolate peanut butter birthday cake" height="332" width="500"></a></p>
<p>But here’s the other best part (you know, if the notion of a boston 
cream pie cake wasn’t enough to convince you)–a lot of these cake 
recipes are one-bowl. I even mixed the one below with just a whisk, no 
electric mixer. My dishwasher thanked me. Okay fine, of course I gave 
him the night off; it was his birthday, after all. Which means that I 
applauded the smaller sinkful of dishes even more.</p>

</p><p><b>Sour Cream-Chocolate Cake with Peanut Butter Frosting and Chocolate-Peanut Butter Glaze</b><br>
Adapted, only barely, from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0811854485?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=smitten-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0811854485">Sky High: Irresistable Triple-Layer Cakes</a></p>
<p>This cake is INTENSE. Serve it in the thinnest slices possible, and keep a glass of milk handy.</p>
<p>Makes an 8-inch triple-layer cake; serves 12 to 16 (the book says, I say a heck of a lot more)</p>
<p>2 cups (250 grams) all-purpose flour<br>
2 1/2 cups (500 grams) sugar<br>
3/4 cup (about 65 grams) unsweetened cocoa powder, preferably Dutch process<br>
2 teaspoons baking soda<br>
1 teaspoon salt<br>
1 cup (235 ml) neutral vegetable oil, such as canola, soybean or vegetable blend<br>
1 cup (240 grams) sour cream<br>
1 1/2 (355 ml) cups water<br>
2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar<br>
1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>
2 large eggs</p>
<p>1/2 cup coarsely chopped peanut brittle (I skipped this)</p>
<p>1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter the bottoms and sides of
 three 8-inch round cakepans. Line the bottom of each pan with a round 
of parchment or waxed paper and butter the paper.</p>
<p>2. Sift the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt into a 
large bowl. Whisk to combine them well. Add the oil and sour cream and 
whisk to blend. Gradually beat in the water. Blend in the vinegar and 
vanilla. Whisk in the eggs and beat until well blended. Scrape down the 
sides of the bowl and be sure the batter is well mixed. Divide among the
 3 prepared cake pans.</p>
<p>3. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a cake tester or wooden 
toothpick inserted in the center comes out almost clean. Let cool in the
 pans for about 20 minutes. Invert onto wire racks, carefully peel off 
the paper liners, and let cool completely. (Deb note: These cakes are 
very, very soft. I found them a lot easier to work with after firming 
them up in the freezer for 30 minutes. They’ll defrost quickly once 
assembled. You’ll be glad you did this, trust me.)</p>
<p>4. To frost the cake, place one layer, flat side up, on a cake stand 
or large serving plate. Spread 2/3 cup cup of the Peanut Butter Frosting
 evenly over the top. Repeat with the next layer. Place the last layer 
on top and frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining 
frosting. (Deb note 1: Making a crumb coat of frosting–a thin layer that
 binds the dark crumbs to the cake so they don’t show up in the final 
outer frosting layer–is a great idea for this cake, or any with a dark 
cake and lighter-colored frosting. Once you “mask” your cake, let it 
chill for 15 to 30 minutes until firm, then use the remainder of the 
frosting to create a smooth final coating. Deb note 2: Once the cake is 
fully frosted, it helps to chill it again and let it firm up. The cooler
 and more set the peanut butter frosting is, the better drip effect 
you’ll get from the Chocolate-Peanut Butter Glaze.)</p>
<p>5. To decorate with the Chocolate–Peanut Butter Glaze, put the cake 
plate on a large baking sheet to catch any drips. Simply pour the glaze 
over the top of the cake, and using an offset spatula, spread it evenly 
over the top just to the edges so that it runs down the sides of the 
cake in long drips. Refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 30 minutes to 
allow the glaze and frosting to set completely. Remove about 1 hour 
before serving. Decorate the top with chopped peanut brittle.</p>
<p><b>Peanut Butter Frosting</b><br>
Makes about 5 cups</p>
<p>10 ounces (285 grams) cream cheese, at room temperature<br>
1 stick (115 grams, 4 ounces or 1/2 cup) unsalted butter, at room temperature<br>
5 cups (600 grams) confectioners’ sugar, sifted<br>
2/3 cup (170 grams) smooth peanut butter, preferably a commercial brand (because oil doesn’t separate out)</p>
<p>1. In a large bowl with an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese and 
butter until light and fluffy. Gradually add the confectioners’ sugar 1 
cup at a time, mixing thoroughly after each addition and scraping down 
the sides of the bowl often. Continue to beat on medium speed until 
light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes.</p>
<p>2. Add the peanut butter and beat until thoroughly blended.</p>
<p><b>Chocolate-Peanut Butter Glaze</b><br>
Makes about 1 1/2 cups</p>
<p>8 ounces (225 grams) semisweet chocolate, coarsely chopped<br>
3 tablespoons (50 grams) smooth peanut butter<br>
2 tablespoons (40 grams) light corn syrup, honey or golden syrup<br>
1/2 cup (120 ml) half-and-half</p>
<p>1. In the top of a double boiler or in a bowl set over simmering 
water, combine the chocolate, peanut butter, and corn syrup. Cook, 
whisking often, until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth.</p>
<p>2. Remove from the heat and whisk in the half-and-half, beating until smooth. Use while still warm.</p>

				<p>My boyfriend recently showed be a recipe you posted who knows 
when about peanut butter brownies with chocolate on top. It was the 
first time I’d heard of your blog. I made it and it was delicious.</p>
<p>Now I’m pretty sure he’s going to request this one, too. I wonder if I
 could use this to convince him to help me move my furniture…</p>

				<p>I hate you a little bit for posting this recipe. One because I am
 on a peanut-butter chocolate streak that won’t quit. Two, because it’s 
too late for me to go to the store and buy anything that will gratify 
the craving these pictures has awakened (hate, hard) and three because 
of the merciless teasing I will endure from my non-chocolate-fan husband
 when I do find an excuse to make this cake. Oh well…I’ll do it anyway…</p>
<p>Now if I could just figure out how I ended up in a house that doesn’t have chocolate on hand…</p>

				<p>Firstly, this cake looks AMAZING and I must make it.<br>
Secondly, odd cowinkedink but my older brother, Alex, loves peanut 
butter and chocolate and his birthday passed by recently. Maybe he’s 
living a secret double life and he’s also your husband? In any case he’s
 getting this cake for his birthday next year.</p>

				<p>We have a chocolate bar over here called Kit Kat – do you have 
that? Anyway, it’s just a wafer with chocolatey goodness inside and out 
and now they have a peanut butter version – Oh my God. It’s totally 
converted me to the combo. The way that chocolate is oozing off the 
sides! </p>
<p>Also, does Alex really do the dishes like, all the time? Can you 
arrange for some sort of posting about this so that i can forward it to 
my man? Oh what a sweet arrangement, I cook, he cleans…..</p>

				<p>Bush — Half and half = 1/2 milk + 1/2 cream = 10.5 to 18 percent butterfat. I’ve got this information and more on the <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/tools/" rel="nofollow">“Tools” page</a>.</p>
<p>Chocolatechic — It would be sprinkled on top of the finished cake–Step 5.</p>
<p>Amy — This would indeed work as cupcakes. However, if you’re just 
looking for a chocolate cake recipe, how shall I say it politely, this 
isn’t the strongest chocolate one. The mildness of the chocolate works 
perfectly with the peanut butter combination, but you’re just looking 
for a simple, killer chocolate cupcake, I’d advice you to go with her <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2008/07/project-wedding-cake-the-cake-is-baked/" rel="nofollow">Chocolate Butter Cake</a> (with or without the cinnamon) or this <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2007/07/you-are-owed-chocolate-cake/" rel="nofollow">Epicurious favorite</a>.</p>

				<p>Cake looks great!  I just bought that book, and can’t wait to try
 it out.  You might want to try the peanut butter cake with 
chocolate/peanut butter ganache and cream cheese frosting at Epicurious 
(Bon Appetit). It’s amazing.  Not as much chocolate, but it’s truly 
wonderful – especially once the flavors have melded after 24 hours. It’s
 been my birthday cake three years in a row now!  (without the candy on 
top).</p>

				<p>Erin — Totally forgot to mention that I don’t have more than one 
(oh, and I left it somewhere) 8-inch circle pan so I used 9-inch 
ones–it’s fine. Probably a tad thinner than the super-tall picture in 
the book, but I’m not showing you that because it might make mine look 
bad. ;)</p>

				<p>Oh, my husband will thank you SO MUCH when I finally come up with
 an excuse to make this cake.  (Is it bad to consider throwing a party

				<p>Oh Deb, you bad, bad girl you!  This is hitting my “weakness” 
button way too hard! All of my restraint to enjoy a quiet, baking free 
Tuesday just flew out the window. The commitment to finish necessary 
documents for a major obligation have perished as my chocolate and 
peanut butter obsessions have taken control. My friends will thank you 
profusely, and I will “begrudgingly” admit complete and total defeat.  
Great work!</p>

				<p>I make a very similar version of this, but in cupcake form.  I 
pipe the peanut-butter/cream cheese filling into the center of the 
cupcake, and then do a whipped chocolate ganache frosting on top.  
Delightful!</p>
<p>I’ll have to try this recipe – and get that book.  I’m intrigued by 
the blue cornmeal with caramel cream that you mentioned in your post.</p>

				<p>Do you think the cake part of this recipe is better than the cake
 part of your double chocolate layer cake? Because that cake is the best
 one that has ever come out of my kitches, so I’m tempted to try it with
 this frosting, unless you recommend otherwise.</p>

				<p>Mmmm..the frosting/filling sounds like it would be enough peanut 
butter flavor for the whole cake.  Leave the ganache without PB.   In 
the cake, I would probably nix the vinegar and use coffee instead of the
 water.  I’d also melt butter and use it instead of the oil.  There’s 
something about oil in cakes that just seems to neutralize some of the 
flavor to me.  But, that’s just me!</p>

				<p>Allie — There isn’t one. Just scoop it into a measuring cup, 
press it in really well to make sure there are no air pockets and use a 
rubber or silicone spatula to get it out. The only easier way would be 
if the recipe had weight measurements, but unfortunately none in the 
book do. It’s the only thing I’d want to change about it!</p>
<p>Stella — Actually, no. It’s just as soft and moist (and a bit hard to
 handle, like the other one) but not as chocolate-y. It works with this 
recipe, but if you’re pulling out a chocolate cake recipe, as I mention 
above (#45) either your favorite or the chocolate wedding cake have more
 chocolate pow. The wedding one is more dense and sturdy, but seriously 
amazingly good. (And one bowl!) Hope that helps.</p>

				<p>PB could be my all-time favorite food. And with chocolate, wow. Can’t wait to think of a reason to make this.</p>
<p>I have converted to the natural PB (you know, the one that’s just 
peanuts and salt). I know the recipe says to use commercial PB so the 
oil doesn’t separate, but if you stirred the natural stuff up really 
well, would it still work?? I just wonder if it would be OK since the 
‘commercial’ stuff has sugar added (and possibly other things). Anyone 
know?</p>

				<p>I made a chocolate peanut butter cheesecake kind of thing 
recently. (The entire cake was made of cream cheese and peanut butter, 
then ganache on top.) While it was delicious, I felt really sick after 
eating it. So sick that I would never make it again. Just too rich. 
Maybe this one would be a better solution.</p>

				<p>I love the one-bowl stuff.</p>
<p>So I only have two 9-in pans. Do you think it would be better to 
halve the recipe for thinner layers or go for the full recipe for 2 
thicker layers that hopefully won’t overflow? I would bake the 3rd layer
 separately except for the fact that there’s vinegar in the recipe…</p>

				<p>I love the inclusion of the cream cheese.  What a wonderful 
texture this cake must have!  My sister, also a chocolate and peanut 
butter fiend, requested a <a href="http://scottsfoodblog.com/2008/03/15/peanut-butter-cup-birthday-cake/" rel="nofollow">Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup cake </a>for her birthday.  Though I’m not much of a baker by comparison, I was proud to present her with <a href="http://scottsfoodblog.com/2008/03/15/peanut-butter-cup-birthday-cake/" rel="nofollow">my take</a> on the theme.  The oversized peanut butter cup on top was the crowning jewel.  </p>
<p>Though, my peanut butter filling was <i>too</i> peanut buttery.  It 
didn’t have the same taste as the Reese’s filling.  Do you have any idea
 how to reverse engineer that glorious Reese’s flavor?  In addition to 
cakes, my depression-induced homemade McFlurries will thank you :-)</p>

				<p>Oh yum.  I made a cake very similar to this last month.  I made a
 chocolate cake and used a peanut butter frosting from the Barefoot 
Contessa (Ina Garten).  I also poured a ganache on top and then 
smothered the sides with crushed Reeses cups.  I will have to try it 
with this cream cheese PB frosting!</p>

				<p>Haha Kaitlin I thought of that one too. I love nutella… but I 
fear in this cake it might overpower the chocolate instead of complement
 it like the PB would. or the hazelnut would get lost?</p>
<p>and well i this kind of cake i think BOTH chocolate and the pb should be spotlighted..YUM!!!!</p>

				<p>I have been a dedicated (obsessed) Smitten Kitchen lurker for 
ever and ever and now I am de-lurking only to tell you that my absolute 
favorite growing up snack was a piece of bread topped with cream cheese 
covered in peanut butter then broiled in a toaster oven. And sometimes 
topped with some chocolate chips.  Which I have entirely forgotten, and 
which you now bring me in cake form.  Words cannot express my thanks.  
And also all those people who need an *excuse* to make a cake, 
especially this cake, oh my, how sad for them!</p>

				<p>two ways I know to measure peanut butter:<br>
 one- line the measuring cup with plastic wrap, fill, then just pull up 
the plastic wrap and wipe the peanut butter off the plastic wrap.</p>
<p>two- get an adjustable measuring cup. it has a plastic sleeve around a
 cup, you lift up the plastic sleeve to the desired measurement, fill up
 the cup created by the sleeve, then push up on the cup, scrapes the 
sleeve clean as it empties. You can find them by searching “adjustable 
measuring cup” on amazon, I got mine from pampered chef.</p>

ice cream. Yummy! I can’t wait for an occasion to make this cake.</p>

				<p>Scott — You know what I think the secret to the awesomeness that 
is Reeses peanut butter cup filling? Salt. Quite a bit of it. If you try
 to isolate the taste–and I know this is hard what with the <i>must have it right this very second</i>
 temptation of one–you’ll find that its surprisingly salty, and the 
chocolate is, like most candy bar chocolate, surprisingly sweet. The 
sweet plays off the salty and it’s like crack (um, bad analogy, I know) 
to those of us who love them.</p>
<p>Kaitlin — As for nutella, of course the caveat is that I haven’t 
tried this and if you’re so inclined, who knows, it may work. That said,
 my instincts are saying no. Nutella and peanut butter are wildly 
different substances. Nutella is almost all sugar and syrup, peanut 
butter is ground nuts with oil. They’re not a natural swap in recipes. 
However, if it is the chocolate-hazelnut taste you’re going for, you 
might want to pick up Hazelnut Butter. I know Whole Foods used to make 
some but I haven’t checked in eons. It’s consistency is slightly 
different than that of peanut butter, but it’s a fairly close match. 
They also made Almond Butter back in the day, and I think they still do.</p>

				<p>When I saw the first picture I physically gagged..and quickly minimized the screen.<br>
Not because it wasnt beautiful (b/c it is) but because Ive been forced into a chocolate peanut butter craze by my bf.<br>
I made the double chocolate peanut butter ice cream from thekitchn.com 
earlier today and had a bowl about an hour ago. Im a huge fan of 
chocolate but  not so big on peanut butter.<br>
My boyfriend (who rarely cooks or makes requests) saw the kitchn page 
picture, bookmarked it, and started looking up ice cream machines on 
ebay the same night. This was Thursday evening and by Saturday morning 
we had a new Cuisinart machine (which we got fr. Craigslist for $25!!)</p>
<p>God forbids he sees this recipe. I’ll have to bake this cake and 
theres no way I can stomach more choc.+ PB for at least a few months.</p>
<p>So, thanks to that gorgeous photo, I’ll have to sneak to read your blog for the next week or so..</p>
<p>Bah!</p>

				<p>Aaaaaargh – I saw this recipe this morning, well before the crack
 of sparrow fart and decided that I had all the ingredients and NEEDED 
to make this cake… OH suggested that it isn’t really diet food, but it 
is brown and brown has no calories so I have categorically ignored him, 
invited a great friend around and we’ve made it, frosted it and eaten 
our first slices…  NOW I’M GOING TO HAVE TO EAT MORE!!!  My tastebuds 
thank you, my cravings thank you (my thighs have put a contract out on 
you…. LOL)</p>
<p>What a fantastic recipe!  Thank you so much for sharing. Pure heaven in a slice.</p>
<p>Now I’ve just read the poached eggs post and NEEEEEED to make some of those too@*&amp;%$</p>

				<p>Re the peanut butter and cream cheese combo, I used to make 
peanut butter and cream cheese sandwiches all the time. I have no idea 
who introduced me to them, but it is a great fix. And then there is my 
preferred hangover sandwich, which is peanut butter, mayo, sliced 
tomato, and generous sprinklings of salt and pepper. Another classic!</p>

instead with hazelnut or almond butter. But honestly? I mean, if you’ve

have just got to be better cakes to serve than this, given how crazed

				<p>Deb, you have convinced me to get that book. and i will. do you 
know how much batter that recipe will make? the previous recipes you 
posted from the book stated the amount of batter in cups. it helps me to
 figure out how much to put in each pan. i’m challenged like that. 
thanks!</p>

				<p>Actually, yes! Mine made about 8 cups of batter, which I know 
because I combined it in a large pyrex measuring cup. I put about 2 2/3 
cups of batter in each pan (and they were still uneven, grr, but oh 
well).</p>

				<p>I was set on making a plain old chocolate cake with white 
chocolate icing for my birthday which was yesterday.. Until i read your 
post.. within a second of looking at that first picture i was sold and 
choose to make this instead, thank goodness i did cause this cake was 
orgasmic good. </p>
<p>This was my first attempt at making a layer cake.. so it didnt quite 
turn out as pretty looking as yours did, i guess that takes practice and
 then right tools. I’m looking forward to trying more of the recipes in 
your blog.</p>

				<p>Tried commenting to tell you how scrummy this looked, but for some reason my post wont show up.  Hope this one gets through! </p>
<p>I have always shied away from making layer cakes — the last one i 
made was a coconut cake sometime in 2000 — but I am totally reinspired.</p>

				<p>Deb ~<br>
Once again I want to say I can’t believe how much your photos bring out 
the “get in the kitchen NOW!”  I made the blueberry pancakes they turned
 out PERFECT!- DELICIOUS – LIGHT AND FLUFFY! The funny thing was, was 
that my husband didn’t care for them – he likes the dense ones I’ve been
 making all these years- HA – I can’t believe it!<br>
I am making two of your PB cakes for two events this weekend. I liked 
the idea of peanut brittle and made two batches last night. Believe it 
or not I’ve had the britlle ingredients in my cupboard for WELL over 
five years now waiting for a Christmas when I’m motivated enough to make
 it. I thought the peanuts would be stale and nasty, but the brittle is 
delightful – I just have to keep the humidity down and stop snacking on 
it so there’s enough fot the cakes.<br>
Thanks Again Deb!<br>
~ Mary</p>

				<p>I made this cake last night, and it is so good…and so rich.  I 
did play around with it though.  I made two 9 inch layers.  Then I cut 
each one of those so that I had four thinner layers.  I made a little 
more icing by just throwing a little more of everything into the mixing 
bowl.  I figured since I had four layers I’d need more icing, but I 
don’t know if I would’ve actually needed more.  Anyway…I decided to salt
 the icing after tasting it and thinking “What does this need?”.  I must
 say it was even better than it was originally.  In reference to Scott 
and the Reese’s cup discussion…the salt really makes the cake, in my 
opinion, much more interesting.  There’s no doubt about it, the cake is 
ridiculously sweet with or without the salt, but it helps cut the 
sweetness somewhat.  It tasted more like a Reese’s cup.  Also, I didn’t 
use the peanut brittle, and I left out the corn syrup in the ganache 
too.  Overall a fabulous cake!</p>

				<p>I stayed up late last night to make this after my little one and 
hubby went down for bed. It came out beautifully. This is my new 
favorite cake. I cut two slices for after dinner and took  the rest to 
the office with me(I can’t have so much cake in the house, I will gain 
5lbs). My Cake stand was clean by 10:30 am. This cake was loved by 
everyone. I followed your diections and everything was just right. I 
even had the perfect amount of icing for the 3 layers (I was worried). 
Also, the cake batter was more runny than I thought it should be, but 
the cake baked up perfectly. Thank you for another amazing recipie.</p>

				<p>Okay, already a huge flurry of comments, but had to add in my 2 
cents.  I made this last night for the one year anniversary of our 
weekly <a href="http://www.myspace.com/craftnightseattle" rel="nofollow">Craft Night</a> – there wasn’t a crumb left at the end of the night!<br>
I do have to warn others, though – just because you’re running late and 
started making the cake at the last minute does not mean it’s ok to put 
together and serve before giving it time in the fridge.  The cake 
arrived to the event looking like the Leaning Tower of Pisa – but all 
was forgiven once everyone had a bite of it!</p>

				<p>i made this earlier in the week just because i had the time. it 
was a phenomenal success in the tasting department, although it leaned a
 bit (one of the cake layers didn’t raise evenly). i brought it to work 
and it was declared a success and polished off rather quickly. i loved 
that the taste was not too heavy on the peanut-butter; it was rich, but 
not to the point where i couldn’t finish my slice :)</p>

				<p>Yummity yum.</p>
<p>First, I’ve already ordered the cookbook.</p>
<p>Second, I’ve got one of these chilling in the fridge right now.  It 
looks just wonderful.  I have some thoughts, though.  I only have 9-inch
 cake pans, so I ran with them, and it is still a sky-high cake. Also, I
 thought some of the methods were unusual.  The cake directions have you
 mix the oil and sour cream in, first.  I tried, but my 
inner-anti-over-beating bell was screaming, so I ended up combining 
water through beaten eggs and adding all at once, so that I could 
minimize the stirring.  Cake ended up delicate and tasty. I’m not saying
 that it wouldn’t, following the directions, but if you are concerned, 
or just don’t want to add everything bit by bit, I think you could do a 
standard-issue dry ingredient/wet ingredient mixing job and still get a 
great result. </p>
<p>Then, when making the PB frosting, I though it would be weird and 
deflating to add the PB at the end, after you’ve mixed for 3-4 minutes 
to be fluffy.  So I added it to the cream cheese and butter before the 
sugar.  Love the texture.  Again, I don’t know if it is an improvement; 
it is just that the directions as written sort of went against my Scooby
 sense in the kitchen.</p>
<p>But this cake is gorgeous.  Can’t imagine people not thinking it rocks (and I’m decidedly not a choc/PB person).  </p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

				<p>I love the flavours of this cake, but it really is the ugliest 
cake I have ever made.  It just fell apart, even after I froze the 
layers — one was in the freezer for over an hour and it still wouldn’t 
stay together.  The cake literally fell apart as I was frosting it.  I 
haven’t glazed it yet or tried to cut into it — but I have serious 
reservations that one can even cut a piece from this absolute disaster 
of a cake.  I don’t know what I did wrong, but this cake is beyond soft.
  It can’t even bear the weight of the layers — there’s severe 
subsidence on one side.  I’m beyond frustrated — I love the combo of 
flavours and wanted nothing more than this to work.  Suggestions for the
 next time (if there is one) would be appreciated.</p>

				<p>i’m in the process of making this cake (the layers are cooling 
and the PB frosting is done) and i think i over-mixed the frosting, as 
it went from smooth to a sort of… like the consistency of cream when you
 over-beat it. so, just a warning: don’t overmix the frosting!</p>

				<p>Hey there. My boyfriend found this recipe via digg–and he said I 
should make it. Since he rarely ever shows interest in the recipes I 
make, I decided to make it. I’m glad to have found your blog, though. I 
had ideas of making a recipe blog and about a year ago, filled a MySpace
 blog once a week with recipes and photos. I kind of forgot about it 
after awhile and haven’t been keeping it up. I wish I could do something
 as nice as this! </p>
<p>On another note, I only had two cake pans, so I made the last in a 
smaller copper stewpot (just prepared the bottom the same way). Seems to
 have turned out fine,  but the cake is tiered in a weird way. The 
cake’s in the fridge now, but I took some pics of what mine looks like, 
just on the off-chance you’re interested. Links are below…long, but 
should work. I did want to note that it seemed like there was a whole, 
whole lot of the ganache. I ended up having enough to give the cake a 
whole layer over the frosting…mostly because I hate to waste. I was 
curious if your recipe gave you extra. Anyway, off now, but I will be 
checking out your blog a lot more later. Thanks for the recipes.</p>

				<p>This was the FIRST cake I’ve ever made. It turned out delicious! 
It looks AWFUL though, haha. It’s falling apart and looks like an 
earthquake hit it.  The cake is super moist and fluffy and delicious 
though.</p>
<p>The only thing I’m happy with is that I added sad to the icing and 
it’s a little odd now.  A TINY amount of salt made it better I think but
 just a hair more made it a little too salty.  Very very fine line.  I’m
 quite happy with it for my first cake though! Super yummy, super rich. 
 Also, this cake is MUCH LARGER than I expected! It’s quite huge! haha</p>

came out fantastic. It wasn’t as pretty as yours, but I’m sure it tasted
 just as good!</p>

				<p><a href="http://snipurl.com/3h649" rel="nofollow">http://snipurl.com/3h649</a> – This cake is awesome, but the 5 cups of sugar are waaayy to much in my opinion. The peanut creme was a lot to sweet.</p>

				<p>I made this and it was AMAZING!  The whole cake was finished 
within the hour… which is saying something because it is RICH.  It was 
very time consuming (maybe because I’m such a perfectionist…), but 
actually quite simple.   I -strongly- recommend this recipe.  I already 
have requests to make it again.</p>

				<p>Although my cake looked nothing like yours, I have to say that I 
believe it’s the best cake I’ve ever made! In my life! Wow! I 
compensated for my 9″ pans by 1 1/2 times the cake recipe. Oh my! It was
 a monster! I gave so much of it away and I ate so much of it. I’d be at
 work and tell my friends (who I’d taken cake to) “I can’t wait to get 
home and get into that cake!”</p>
<p>By the way Deb, I didn’t even own cake pans until you put up the 
wedding cake. Everything I’d ever made went into a 9X13 pan. Thanks for 
getting me to do a bit more exploring.<br>

				<p>One complaint – who lists amounts of chocolate chips in ounces??  I don’t have an analytical balance in my kitchen.</p>
<p>Other than that the cake as pictured does look incredible.  I’m making it tonight and hopefully it ends up tasting as good.</p>
<p>Sorry, that ounces thing just really annoyed me, I didn’t notice it 
until I was in the middle of the recipe.  (BTW 1 ounce of chips turns 
out to equal 1/6 of a cup so you need 1 1/3 cups for this recipe)</p>

				<p>But Stephen, you don’t want chocolate chips for this recipe. 
Chips contain less fat and added lecithin to keep them from melting into
 goo in your cookies. Chocolate in bar form melts much more smoothly, 
which is what you want for ganache.</p>

				<p>AMAZING. I had two grown men watching over my shoulder in 
anticipation of getting a bite. Because of that, I skipped putting the 
cakes in the freezer, but after piecing them back together because they 
were so soft and hard to handle, I can see where that would REALLY help!</p>

center of attention… not me! It was themed “all chocolate… all the time”
 and so I also used your truffle recipe and the Dulce de Leche 
cheesecake recipe. Just wanted to let you know that the party should 
have been named “all smitten kitchen…. all the time”. Thanks for the

				<p>I made this for my sister’s 40th birthday party last night and it
 was a big hit!!!  I agree with someone else who skipped the freezing of
 the cakes–skipping that step didn’t work so well for me, either.  But 
only because the cake is so moist and delicate and not at all like a 
commercial sponge.  All of my sisters are bakers and all agreed that the
 cake was delicious.  If you are hesitant because you think that peanut 
butter flavor can be too much, this is the right cake because the peanut
 butter flavor was tempered with the cream cheese and was just awesome. 
 I am going to use each of the recipes separately at times, they were so
 good.  Excellent recipe.  Thanks a bunch!</p>

				<p>To #179 — the recipe probably says ounces for the chocolate glaze
 because baking chocolate ( i.e. Bakers or Nestle Chocolatier or some of
 the more expensive brands like Scharffenberger ) is sold in ounces.  1 
square = 1 oz.  Of course, the chocolate chips will work also.  But 
often recipes call for a higher quality chocolate than chocolate chips.</p>

				<p>My 20 year old son is a chocolate peanut butter lover and last 
week presented me with a printout of this recipe.  I have three teenage 
boys and they all loved this cake.  My first attempt was a bit sloppy 
since I didn’t have three identical cake pans or parchment paper, but 
yesterday I went shopping to get all the necessary tools (who knew what 
an offset spatula was?)  Anyway, my second attempt which I assembled on a
 lovely cake stand was an absolute work of art.  This is undoubtedly one
 of the best cakes I’ve ever tasted, bar none.  It will be my offering 
at any future gathering where I happen to be invited.  Thanks for this 
recipe!  (Next time I will use the higher grade chocolate for the glaze,
 but honestly, the glaze tasted yummy with just the nestles chocolate 
chips.)</p>

				<p>I forgot to get back to you on my results.<br>
YUM! It was stunning with the large pieces of peanut brittle on the top.<br>
The cake by itself was something else – I could’ve just eaten that it 
was so delicious!  Since I was going to two events and traveling a good 
bit of the way (7 hour drive) I made a double batch and baked it in 9×13
 pans and froze them for the trip.  When I got to my destination I cut 
them in half and made two 9×6 cakes. I also added an extra cup of peanut
 butter to the cream cheese frosting.<br>
At the first dinner party we ate the cake RIGHT AWAY! No one wanted to be too full to eat cake after a big meal and alcohol.<br>
THANK YOU Deb for a STELLAR recipe!</p>

				<p>GREAT recipe — I made it for my friend’s birthday.  Had some 
issues getting it to rise (I’m not the world’s best cake baker) but it 
still came out nicely.  I see what you mean about freezing the layers — 
maybe I’ll freeze ‘em for a bit longer next time.  I was a little 
worried that there might end up being TOO much peanut butter but I was 
totally wrong — the PB and chocolate complemented each other PERFECTLY. 
 This TOTALLY goes in the “keep” recipe pile.  Thanks so much for 
sharing it with us!!!</p>

				<p>I made this cake for my brother’s birthday in August.  It was a

Peter Pan peanut butter for the frosting and glaze and found that it was
 so sweet and un-peanutty that I wished I had tried another brand.  Any 
suggestions???</p>

				<p>Wow- this cake is a show-stopper!! As Deb promised, it is easy to
 make and comes out looking oh so professional. Like others have said, 
it is VERY rich, which is why it serves many more people than it seems. I
 added at least a cup less powdered sugar than the recipe called for and
 added salt to the peanut butter frosting. I also used only 2 layers. 
One sugesstion- make sure to serve this at a cool temperature, as the 
heat can make it sort of greasy tasting. YUM!</p>

Thank you!  I’m so glad I read this post thoroughly as the cake really 
benefits from being in the freezer for a bit.  I also put in a cup less 
of icing sugar and it was perfect (for us).  The flavours all blended so
 well together…who knew that cream cheese and peanut butter would be 
such good friends?!!  Definitely a foodgasm moment!</p>

				<p>I made this for the Boy’s birthday over the weekend, since he is a
 big time devotee of peanut butter. Honestly, the first slice was a 
little much, but I think it’s actually gotten better as it’s been 
sitting in the fridge since Saturday night. If I were going to make it 
again – wait, when I make it again – I think I’ll do it a day or so 
ahead. It seems moister now, and cream cheese/ganache toppings hold up 
well anyway.</p>
<p>And the peanut butter frosting? My god. Mmmmm. There’s some left in a
 tupperware in there and it’s taking a lot of willpower to not go eat it
 with a spoon. What? It’s got protein! and calcium!</p>

				<p>YUM!  I have this cookbook too and made the chocolate-peanut 
butter cake recently (who could resist!)  I am curious though–how did 
you get the peanut butter frosting looking so pretty!  My cake was super
 crumbly and I could barely ice it without pulling off big chunks.  It 
sure tasted delicious, but it wasn’t exactly winning any beauty 
pageants!</p>

				<p>I just made this for a friend’s birthday (I halved it, and used 
three little cake pans) and it turned out AWESOME.  The best cake I’ve 
ever made.  Thanks, Deb!</p>

				<p>I just made this cake this afternoon. I think it’s the richest 
thing I’ve ever made (and I bake a lot of cakes, having gone thru a 
professional pastry chef course). A little too rich for me, but my 
husband loves it.</p>
<p>I’ve cut about 10 slices of it (to give to friends) and it’s half 
gone. Next time I’d halve the glaze recipe: I made 8″ layers and that 
amount of glaze covered the entire cake, with spillage. And yes, the 
cakes were very soft. I didn’t freeze them but kept them together with 
careful handling and judicious use of cake circles. Cut this cake with a
 knife run under hot water and wipe the knife with a cloth between cuts.</p>

				<p>So could I get away with making this in TWO 9″ pans instead of 
three?  I’m not all that interested in buying a third cake pan, but I’m 
worried that the cakes are going to be even softer with more batter in 
each pan.  Pour off extra batter into cupcakes?  Thoughts?</p>

room was silent.  It was so rich people could not finish their slices, 
HOWEVER, everyone requested a plate to take the rest home to eat later 
on!!  </p>
<p>Everyone said it was the best cake they have ever had.  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe and beautiful photos.</p>

				<p>Deb,<br>
Thank you so much for posting this recipe.  My best friend and I are big
 fans of your blog – I actually found it about 2 years ago through your 
friend Jocelyn’s blog.  My best friend made this for my birthday 2 weeks
 ago and it is AMAZING.  I had no idea that cream cheese and peanut 
butter could make such a perfect combination.  Your recipe made this the
 most memorable cake in awhile.  I haven’t enjoyed a birthday cake this 
much since a little bakery in Banksville, NY used to make the most 
wonderful Grand Marnier cake.</p>

				<p>I’m halfway through my second making of this magnificent cake.  
The first time I made it my teenage boys said it was the best cake they 
had ever had in their life.  I’m making this one for a surprise for a 
friend’s birthday, but I’ve already told her husband that I will have to
 take some of it homw with me after I give it to her or my kids will 
never forgive me.</p>

				<p>My only real problem when I made this cake was getting the glaze 
to look as pretty as your pictures. Well, you know, not all over the 
cake plate anyway. I poured about half of it on and it looked just 
gorgeous, but I couldn’t resist trying to put more and more on… Did I 
just pour it when it was too warm? Should I have put it in the 
refrigerator sooner? (I’m sorry if this was mentioned in the comments 
already… I tried to look through most of them.)</p>

				<p>The best trick to get the ganache to cling but not run too much 
is to chill the frosted cake before you use it. Cold is your best friend
 when assembling cakes. Because the peanut butter icing will be cold, it
 will dribble down more slowly. Just only pour a tablespoon or two at a 
time–you can always add more if it doesn’t drip down enough.</p>

				<p>Oh. My. God.</p>
<p>I made this cake this morning, and we just had it for dessert after 
dinner. Quote from my 3rd grader, who is a good eater: “I can’t think of
 a way to make this cake any better.”</p>
<p>And my kindergartner, who is quite a fussy diner, was motivated to 
eat his BBQ chicken, blue cheese potato salad and steamed green beans by
 the prospect of devouring a slab of this unbelievable cake.</p>
<p>Finally, my wife, for whom I made the cake, and who is a chocolate 
and peanut butter-a-holic, was moaning at the dinner table in ecstasy.</p>
<p>My entire family thanks you!</p>

				<p>I made this cake this afternoon to take to a church function this
 evening!  It was such a hit!  Everyone wanted a piece!  I didn’t put 
the peanut butter into the chocolate glaze, I was afraid it would 
over-power the chocolate.  I used Reese’s peanut butter chips on top of 
the glaze.  It was gorgeous and I can’t wait to make it again!  I loved 
all the helpful hints you put throughout the recipe, very helpful. Thank
 you Deb for the fantastic recipe!  Have you ever made Paula Deen’s 
Chocolate Creme de menthe cake?  You MUST try it!  Google that recipe – 
you’ll thank me!</p>

				<p>I just made this cake… and learned a few lessons.  I only mangled
 one of the three layers taking it out of the pan (running a knife 
around the pan before inverting it onto the cooling rack really helps). 
 My only other problem was frosting the thing.  Apparently I need more 
practice because my “crumb coating” took a lot more icing than I 
anticipated.  I think I read somewhere that you can coat a small amount 
melted butter onto the sides of a cake and it will help prevent the 
crumbling when frosting.  Putting the cake in the freezer before pouring
 the ganache really helps!  I poured the entire lot of ganache onto the 
top of the cake, and it didn’t even flow over the sides without some 
spreading on my part.  In the end though, the cake tastes great!</p>

				<p>I wanted to make this cake as soon as I saw it posted.  I finally
 got the chance this weekend and it turned out beautifully.  Putting the
 cake in the fridge to firm up, as the directions say, is really a must.
  The frosting and the glaze turned out beautifully with the cooling 
time.  I’m not one to be daunted by too much chocolate, but as Deb says,
 this cake is really rich. I served the cake with some vanilla bean ice 
cream, that was the perfect complement to cut through the sweetness.  I 
enjoyed every bite.</p>

				<p>This cake made absolutely delicious cupcakes – just half the 
recipe for all three components and it will make about 18-20 cupcakes.  I
 made the cake as well (obsessed much?!) a week before, and anyone who 
had a bite agreed it was the most awesome cake in the universe.  Once 
you go triple layer, you’ll never go back!</p>

				<p>Hey Guys! I am Asimah from Pakistan. I made this cake yesterday 
and like it says: it was succulent but way too heavy. And do, I did 
serve a glass of milk with it. But I had slight problem with the peanut 
butter filling. My peanut butter mixture was not smooth. It has granules
 of sugar and when you ate it, it make the ‘krunch krunch’ sound of 
sugar in your mouth. That was the only flaw. I have uploaded a pic of 
the cake too. If anyone could help, I’d be obliged.<br>

				<p>I just made this cake for my crazy-for-peanut-butter boyfriend, 
and it did not disappoint.  I mean, WOW.  Guest comments ranged from 
“wow, where did you buy this?” to “this cake is OUTRAGEOUS.”  And it 
was.  </p>
<p>Instead of peanut brittle, I chopped up some mini peanut butter cups 
from Trader Joe’s and sprinkled them on top of the cake for added oomph.
  HIGHLY recommended.  Click on my name to see pictures on Flickr.</p>

Not only is it an amazing cake, but it is straight forward, easy to 
make, and forgiving.  Case in point, I only had two 9″ pans so I put the
 two in the oven with the third still in the bowl.  A couple minutes 
later I realized I had forgotten to add the eggs to the batter. I pulled
 the pans out of the oven, scraped them back into the bowl, added the 
eggs then poured the batter back in the pans.  Many cakes would have 
been offended this one took it right in stride!</p>

				<p>I read this blog all the time, and when I saw this cake I knew I 
had to make it sometime soon.  I am the unofficial birthday cake baker 
in my office and finally a self-professed chocolate peanut butter 
lover’s b-day came up!  She is lactose intolerant so I made a peanut 
butter swiss meringue buttercream for the frosting.  The cake was 
AMAZING.  It earned rave reviews, and three others requested the cake 
for their birthdays as well.  I’ve put the Sky High book on my christmas
 list already!  Thanks for the great recipes!</p>

				<p>Call me crazy for trying to make this even richer,  but would 
this work if i crushed up some peanut buter cups, and added them to the 
cake batter  or mabye? butterfinger?  im just trying to add some PB 
flaor to the make itself and cake a one layer cake<br>
thanks for the help!</p>

				<p>Okay, I’ve been drooling over this recipe for the past month or 
so and have finally found an occasion to make it! However, I’m a bit of a
 novice – at least equipment wise I guess. I don’t have a double-boiler,
 do you think it would be okay to just either nuke the chocolate bits 
for the drizzling, or would it even be all right just using like 
chocolate sauce (ice cream sauce or similar) mixed with PB be okay?<br>
Very excited nonetheless to do this tomorrow!</p>

				<p>Ryane – just put a heatproof bowl with your chocolate/peanut 
butter/corn syrup mixture over a couple inches of simmering water, and 
there’s your double-boiler.  No equipment needed! (besides a pot, and 
bowl…)<br>
Make sure the bowl doesn’t touch the simmering water though, and be 
careful of the steam when you lift the bowl up.  I always wear an oven 
mitt, just in case.</p>

				<p>seriously the best chocolate cake I have ever tasted…besides my grandma’s.<br>
I am a noob when it comes to baking and cooking, and was afraid that I 
wouldn’t be able to make it. I got over my fear, after looking at the 
pictures 3 times  a day, and finally made it. It was pretty easy and I 
followed the recipe exact.<br>
will make this again, certainly soon…before the holidays.<br>
Perfecto!</p>

				<p>WOW!!! how amazing it is to see that so many people are excited 
about this cake.  It is definitely a family favorite.  Sky High 
represents 6 months of just testing recipes, that does not include all 
of the other steps taken to produce the book.  Nothing makes me happier 
that hearing people get excited about trying the recipes.  The 
photographer and the food stylist did an amazing job making the cakes 
look a beautiful as they do in the book.  Thanks to all that have given 
Sky High such wonderful praise, I truly appreciate it.</p>

				<p>I just made this for my husband for dinner tonight (as a 
something special!)  He isn’t a huge cake fan, so I always have problems
 getting him to move beyond my carrot cake, but he can’t wait to try 
this.  Unfortunately, mine is no where near as beautiful as yours 
because my ganache was too thick and smooshed the cake a bit – I really 
need a double boiler!  But I can’t wait to try it and I’ll see what I 
can do for the duplicate I’m making for him to take to work tomorrow.</p>
<p>I found your blog through some friends, and I have to say you’re my new favorite!  Thanks!</p>

				<p>Thank you, thank you, thank you so much for sharing this 
wonderful recipe. I had spent some time looking for a recipe for a cake 
for my husbands birthday which was on Sunday – its been a few years 
since I baked a cake, usually I buy one from a store … this worked out 
perfect, it was a lot easier to do than it looked and my husband said it
 was the best cake he has ever eaten by a country mile …. here are my 
pics – thanks again Deb.<br>

				<p>This cake was a huge hit!  Mine was a bit unconventional, as I 
left out the ganache and shaped it into a… well, I…  I made a 
bachelorette party cake (fyi- the pb icing makes for easy molding and a 
great color!!)  In any case, I dream of making this cake in it’s full 
triple-layer glory.  I have recently stumbled upon your website, and am 
now addicted!  Plans to make the chocolate stout cake and the orange 
chocolate cake (can you say “Halloween Cake”??)….. oh, and also some 
substantial foods as well, in the near future!</p>

				<p>This cake is a MUST DO for me.  Since there are only 2 of us at 
home, I am going to make it and freeze each layer.  I will then assemble
 one at a time when we desire it.  The WOW factor of 3 layers will be 
saved for entertaining and it will be a WOW!!!!  The ganache firms up 
and will stay in the fridge indefinately if tightly wrapped.  Just take 
out as much as needed for the top and warm it to the “dripping” stage.  I
 love to bake and this cake is a winner.</p>

				<p>I made this cake last week and it was a very good cake! I baked 
this cake for my running buddies and OL (office Ladies). The cake is 
super moist and even “moistier” the next day. It is super rich – I only 
made half the frosting knowing that it will be too rich. I frosted 
thinner on the top but reg on the sides. I wonder if the cake will be 
okay with half the oil and possibily subing the oil for butter?</p>

				<p>This cake is the very best chocolate cake ever, and so so 
easy…It’s a one-bowl wonder!  I’ve always baked Hershey’s Black Magic 
Cake, but this recipe is even better!  I think it might be the addition 
of the sour cream.  However,rather than the 1-1/2 cups of water, I added
 1-1/2 cups of cooled, freshly brewed, strong coffee which was leftover 
from the morning (just like the Black Magic Cake)!  This is now my “GO 
TO” chocolate cake recipe, forever.   Try the addition of the coffee 
instead of water…I think you’ll like it.  So glad to discover your 
website.  I LOVE IT!</p>

				<p>Can someone help me, Deb, maybe? My daughter’s birthday party is 
tomorrow afternoon &amp; she has requested this cake. Do you recommend 
making the cake layers &amp; then freezing them &amp; assembling the 
whole cake with frosting tomorrow? Or making the whole cake today and 
refrigerating until tomorrow? Advice from anyone would be appreciated. 
I’m making the cake part right now.</p>

				<p>Hi Joylynn — You could easily make the whole cake today; it will 
keep fine assembled and ready to go. Alternately, you could do 
everything but the ganache, leaving that for the last minute so it looks
 as fresh and shiny as possible. Or, you could make all three cake 
layers today, flash freeze them (this cake is so soft, it is much easier
 to lift and stack the layers frozen), then wrap them well in plastic 
overnight and frost it in the morning. Hope that helps.</p>

				<p>Hi Deb,<br>
Thanks for your help and quick response. I have the first two layers in 
the oven now and will bake the third after they are cooled since I only 
have 2 pans. I think I will plan to do all of the frosting in the 
morning. I’m sure it will be easier with the frozen cakes because I’m 
kind of a layer cake novice. I’m glad you have lots of tips listed with 
the recipe–it will help me greatly.</p>

				<p>Update: The cake was very moist and extremely delicious. Everyone
 at the party loved it. I made the cakes yesterday &amp; froze them 
overnight. That made it very easy to frost them today and I didn’t need a
 crumb coat for the top. I made the ganache in a glass bowl in the 
microwave–I put all of the ingredients in the bowl at the same time and 
used very low heat &amp; checked &amp; stirred it frequently. It worked 
perfectly.<br>
Thanks, Deb!  I will definitely make this again.</p>

				<p>Hi Lyra — If it was warm where you were, 3 hours might have been 
too long. The cake is so soft and tender, I find that having it a bit 
chilled–or at least not out more than an hour in a warm place–helps its 
flavor and sliceability.</p>

 open package of cream cheese, a stick of butter, confectioner’s sugar 
and you totally saved the day!</p>

The cake was so dense and moist — the complete opposite of a box mix 
(which I despise). Thanks for all of your tips! We cut very small 
slivers! Also, I was not skeptical of the peanut butter cream cheese 
combination at all. We make a peanut butter pie like that, and it’s just
 fabulous!</p>

				<p>My boyfriend made this cake for my birthday, and it was awful.  I
 totally lied to him, because he is not very good in the kitchen and he 
went on and on about all the work he put into this.  I didn’t have the 
heart to be honest.  However, I’m afraid he will make this is “signature
 cake” and start making it for other people who will also be forced to 
lie. The cake part was really, really thick–almost like a super-thick 
pudding. Over all it just didn’t taste right.  I kept cutting myself a 
piece and then proclaimed that it’s just too rich to finish.  Any ideas 
on what could have gone wrong?  I am considering making it to see if 
it’s his fault or if it’s just that I (and my mother) don’t like this 
cake.</p>

				<p>This cake was slightly time consuming (probably because I made it
 on a lazy Sunday and had fun with it) but SO WORTH IT. I made it for 
the boyfriend’s birthday and he was very impressed. If you even remotely
 like Reese’s cups, this one’s for you.</p>
<p>Note: I freaked out when I realized I had used the last of my white 
vinegar and hadn’t replaced it yet- no time to go get more! I used apple
 cider vinegar to replace it and it turned out fine.</p>

<p>This cake looks amazing (and the few crumbs that I’ve had tasted it 
too).  I am in the middle of making it, just need to add the chocolate 
glaze.  Your tips about freezing the cake periodically are totally 
essential!  I didn’t freeze the middle layer enough and it was almost 
disastrous! Other readers should definitely follow your notes.  </p>
<p>I’ll let you know how it tastes when I’m done with it.  Thanks again for sharing your insights.</p>

				<p>Deb –<br>
This cake was great! However, I didn’t realize the cake layers would be 
so fragile, even with partial freezing (removing them from the plans was
 – um – interesting), and I would skip the brittle next time.  Also, I 
thought the glaze was a bit too much – can one describe a glaze as 
“clunky”?  Next time I’ll make one more like the ganache glaze topping 
to your mosaic brownie cheesecake.<br>
And speaking of that cheesecake:  It showed up as the “one year ago” 
recipe the day the peanut butter cake recipe appeared, and now I’ve made
 both for the same friend’s birthday dinner.  Please continue the 
tradition next year, so I can make her another fabulous dessert!</p>

				<p>Whoo-eee, powerful stuff! I was very pleased with the results and
 this cake was so fun to make. I want to try a cupcake version with an 
injected peanut butter frosting center next. </p>
<p>But next time it is necessesary to slam-dunk the competition, the whole cake it is!</p>

				<p>I found this peanut butter cake recipe and was impressed with 
your narrative and beautiful photos.  I chose it for my 10-year old 
daughter’s birthday — she’s been saying that peanut butter cups are her 
favorite candy lately.  And all I can say is —  WOW!!  This may be the 
best cake I have ever made, and that’s saying a lot, since I pride 
myself in cake making, and I make a homemade cake for every family 
member’s birthday, plus the occasional cake for a friend’s birthday, and
 other special occasions.  This was rich, peanut buttery, and absolutely
 delicious.  I must admit that I just used a cake mix devils food cake 
as the base, since I find from-scratch cakes are rarely better than cake
 mix cakes (and I have tried many – I really am serious about cakes!)  
Anyway, thanks, and bravo!  P.s. — I believe you have convinced me to 
buy the book, too.</p>

				<p>Hi deb – i really kind of love you for posting this recipe.  My hips, however…maybe not so much.<br>
Anyway, i was planning on making this cake for a lab potluck monday.  
I’ll be gone this weekend so i was going to make the cake layers today 
and finish it up on sunday night.  However, my dear husband mentioned to
 me just(!) last night we will be attending a thanksgiving-ish potluck 
this weekend and could i please make something for that?  Would this 
cake travel well, or would you (could you) make any recommendations for 
other delicious (and similar) cake recipes that i could use instead?  I 
am basically a lazy baker and would hate to make two separate recipes 
for the potluck monday and potluck saturday.<br>
I am SO EXCITED about the peanut butter frosting, though.</p>

				<p>About a year ago for my birthday I wanted a chocolate peanut 
butter cake but I couldn’t find a decent recipe or even a store-bought 
cake so I lived in a state of disappointment until this past October. A 
friend recommended your blog and while browsing your spectacular site,  I
 found this recipe. I swear the clouds parted and angels started singing
 “Hallelujah”. I made this and it was FANTASTIC. This was my first cake 
that I made from scratch. I made it as a bundt cake to make it easier on
 myself, and I was thrilled when it turned out. I’m making it for my 
family this Christmas and I can’t wait for my mother’s reaction as her 
two favorite things are chocolate and peanut butter. Thank you for 
posting this recipe and making my chocolate peanut butter cake dreams 
come true :)</p>

				<p>Hi Deb,</p>
<p>I am planning on making this for a party on Friday, but Thursday is 
Thanksgiving and I am spending all day Friday preparing the rest of the 
food for the party–do you think I could make the components on 
Wednesday, keep the cake in the freezer and the frosting in the fridge 
until Friday, and assemble after 2 days?</p>

				<p>I realize this is Thanksgiving day and so respond whenever you 
get time again…but my cakes tend to rise more in the middle and I 
couldn’t help notice how even your layers seem to be. After I had 
frosted the first layer and laid down the second,there was quite a gap 
on the outer edges.  I just filled them with more frosting for now, but 
in the future, how could I prevent this?</p>

				<p>Good God you were not kidding.  I made a four layer cake and NO 
ONE could finish their slice.  I also topped it with Reece’s Pieces.  
They’re not kidding about the softness of the cake though, fridge or 
freezer for at least 30 minutes is required before iciing.</p>

				<p>In any case…I ended up using the Best Chocolate Cake Recipe Ever 
instead of this one, it traveled beautifully, this cake dissappeared 
within about an hour of being set out and OH MY GOD that ganache really 
sends the whole thing over the moon, doesn’t it?<br>
(My husband happened to catch me while I was making a double recipe of 
the frosting and was all “My god, are you sure you should be using that 
much butter?”.  He is henceforth banned from the kitchen while I am 
baking for his own good.)</p>

				<p>I am planning on bringing this cake to a party, but I need to 
decorate it.  (specifically, with a red snapper made out of sprinkles)  
Do you think the cake will be really delicious sans ganache, or do you 
think the ganache is necessary?  Also, how well do you think decorations
 will show up on that dark ganache?  Thanks so much, this looks amazing!</p>

				<p>I did find a better peanut butter frosting.  It’s Ina Garten’s.  
It has a cup of peanut butter and NO cream cheese.  It is SOOOOO much 
better.  I also used a Hershey’s chocolate cake recipe instead of this 
one which turned out much more like cake.  It was truly amazing and not 
as difficult as this one.</p>

				<p>can anyone help me, possibly deb? i don’t know why but i’m having
 some problems with the glaze. the first time i did the cake it came out
 just wonderfully, but then this second time around it’s not looking as 
it should.</p>
<p>after melting everything together and making sure everything’s 
smooth, i added the half-and-half after removing the bowl from the heat 
but the entire thing comes out chunky (kind of fluffy) and not liquidy 
pourable at all. what did i do wrong? i unfortunately have the worst 
memory in the world and don’t remember how or what i did the first time 
around, so i’m completely baffled…</p>

gets too hot. If so, there is nothing that can be done do repair it. 
Otherwise, I’m stumped. Not being in the kitchen with you, I’m just

 upon this recipe and made it for them. I was delicious. My family-and

It looks divine!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>

				<p>This cake has become part of my life!!!! My brother in law is in 
love with it (all he wanted for his recent 30th birthday) and my kids, 
and son’s friends ask me to make it for them all the time!!! Since I’m 
the mother of three under 6-<br>
(one being 10 weeks old) I’ve had to make some changes to cut time-  The
 first is I use Betty Crocker butter recipe chocolate cake(I use a 
little vanilla in the mix)-  I also have cut the amount of sugar in the 
peanut butter frosting to 3 cups, added a cup and a half of peanut 
butter (instead of 3/4 cup), and a pinch of salt (this makes it a little
 less sweet and more peanut-buttery) and I drizzle the chocolate ganache
 over the top- that way the chocolate isn’t over-powering-<br>
Thank you for this amazing cake!!!!! You’ve made me very popular among family and friends….</p>

was a HUGE hit! The other boss (non-birthday boy) had 5, count them, 5

				<p>Have been dying to try this recipe and finally got around to it 
today. I was so worried because the cake batter was a little runnier 
than I’m used to, but it baked up fine. All the individual components 
tasted wonderful once made, the cake looked absolutely amazing after 
everything was put together. I almost didn’t want to cut it up and serve
 it, but I’m so glad I did. The cake tastes FANTASTIC, everyone had rave
 reviews. Best eaten with a glass of milk. Thanks so much for sharing 
this recipe.</p>

				<p>My friend sent me this recipe in August with the subject line of 
“I’ll love you forever if you make this.”  It’s become my go-to dessert 
for game nights, last days of classes, birthdays, etc!  I’ve made it in 
cupcake form several times, which gives it a fun spin.  Thank you so 
much for sharing this recipe!</p>

				<p>I found this recipe months ago and just had to save it for my 
birthday this past week, and it was absolutely delicious. All of your 
tips were perfect, thank you for being such an inspiration with your 
food! The only thing we did wrong was negelecting the advice about the 
thinnest slices possible- this was a fantastically rich cake!!</p>

				<p>I made this cake today for my son’s birthday. It was so good. 
Since discovering this blog about six months ago it’s been a huge 
inspiration to me. I even twitter’d the whole experience! Thank you 
again for your work on this blog and you definitely have my vote for 
every possible award.</p>

				<p>I made this cake but substituted almond butter for peanut butter.
  It was so so good.  I can’t wait to do it with peanut butter… now all I
 need is a reason.</p>

				<p>This cake has cursed me!  It is so delicious that it is now that 
ONLY cake that is requested for birthdays!  I have made it twice and 
have another occasion coming up where it has been made clear I am only 
welcome if I come with the cake. Luckily it is the best cake ever, and 
watching the eyes of the unanointed widen with joy and disbelief is one 
of the best feelings ever.</p>

				<p>I just made this cake yesterday, and Seriously, it is delicious. 
Worth the extra effort. The Peanut butter frosting works wonderfully to 
hold the soft layers together if they break apart as you stack them. A 
new FAMILY FAVORITE… I also thought of making it in cupcake form or even
 a 9 x 13, if i am being lazy..</p>

				<p>OH MY GOD! This cake is something else, let me tell you. 
Chocolaty, perfectly moist,subtly peanut buttery and a hit of cream 
cheese at the end. I used 3 cups of icing sugar instead of 5 in the 
peanut butter icing and it was plenty sweet. Also, I omitted the corn 
syrup in the chocolate ganache. And do follow the cake chilling and the 
crumb coat steps for the icing.<br>
You have to make this cake! *****</p>

It’s such an easy recipe – I can’t believe I didn’t make it sooner…then

				<p>Hot damn that’s a RICH cake! And delicious! I made it today for 
my boyfriend’s 30th birthday and took it into his work — I’ve never seen
 this group of gluttonous guys unable to finish a slice of cake. (I 
warned them to cut thin slices, but no one listened.) It got rave 
reviews, then everyone promptly snuck off to take a nap.</p>
<p>The peanut butter frosting was a little too sweet for me, probably 
because I accidentally bought salt-free peanut butter. I was really 
pleased with the consistency of the cake — my bf is a baking snob and 
always complains that cakes are too dry, but this had a really moist, 
heavy consistency.</p>

				<p>I helped my friend Noe make this cake.  We turned it into 
cupcakes and it was a truly beautiful experience.  The cupcakes were 
very dense and intensely chocolatey, and the peanut butter icing really 
balanced it out.  The glaze was hard to put on a small cupcake, but it 
tasted insanely good!  This recipe is officially my favorite dessert :) 
The only thing is when you make it cupcakes, you end up with a ton of 
extra peanut butter icing (like that’s a bad thing)</p>

sugary peanut butter? No one ever specifies! Thanks!! My mom told me

				<p>I have made this cake twice with wonderful results and rave 
reviews both times.  The first time I put it into the freezer for a hour
 or so before I frosted it.  The second I made the cake on Monday and 
let it set until Tuesday and then I put the frosting on it.  It dried 
out a little Monday night but after I put the frosting on Tuesday and 
served it Wednesday it was great.  I also doubled the receipe and made 2
 –  13×9 cakes, instead of the round layer cakes, just let it bake 15 
minutes longer..  It will easily searve 40 people this way and I needed 
it for a large group.  This is a cake I will be making for a long time.</p>

				<p>So, I made this cake for my husband’s birthday and he absolutely 
loved it!  All he could say was, “Oh, Baby.” :)  His request is usually 
the same as your husband’s, “Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate”, but when I
 saw this I knew I had to make it for him.  He’s begged me to make 
another one ever since!  Thanks!</p>

				<p>I’m making this for the second time, only I’m cheating and using a
 cake mix for the cake. I figure I am making up for it with the 
frosting, because I’m using Amish butter and the new fancy peanut butter
 from JIF that’s supposed to be more organic or something or other. In 
any case the peanut butter is less sugary, and the Amish butter plus the
 slightly oily, less sugary peanut butter has made something DE-VINE. 
It’s not as sweet and rich as it was the first time around, but I 
learned my lesson then and am just using the frosting as filling. Sure, a
 layer cake without the sides frosted isn’t as pretty, but it’ll have 
ganache goop drizzling down the sides to hide that part. I am really 
looking forward to my fiancee’s (last time I made it, boyfriend’s) 
birthday tomorrow…because I want to taste this cake. Now my only dilemma
 is whether or not I should, in the rush that will be tomorrow morning, 
try to make a second set of layers to go on top of this cake. It looks 
rather dinky when I consider potentially ten people eating this thing. 
Hmm.</p>
<p>Maybe I will try to work some magic and add two layers for dramatic effect.</p>

				<p>I just made this for a coworkers birthday and it was a HUGE hit. 
 I like that the peanut butter flavor wasn’t over the top or ‘in your 
face’ like some of the cakes that use peanut butter cups in the layering
 or on top.  It WAS SUPER rich, but not to peanut butter-y.  AND, it 
looked delicious.  Refrigerating the cake before adding the ganache made
 a huge difference.  I’ll be trying that with more of my cakes that have
 a similar recipe.  I loved this recipe.  I’m now thinking of all kinds 
of cream cheese frostings (maple, maybe strawberry, oh, the 
possibilities!) that I could do next time instead of peanut butter.  
THANKS!</p>

				<p>Hi Deb,<br>
Ive made this cake twice already and it was a huge hit. Everyone loved it!<br>
Im going to make it again for a friends baby shower, but was trying to 
bake it in a bigger pan and possibly doubling the recipe if necessary. I
 wanted to ask if you could suggest which size pan to do this in 
(preferably square) and if a 13 by 9 inch glass one would be ok? And if I
 did do it in the glass pan, would I need to double the batter? Thank 
you so much! The cake is soooo delicious and popular among my friends, I
 just wanted to make it again but bigger!</p>

				<p>Hi-You wrote that you made first two layers then the third.  Does anything happen to the batter while waiting?<br>
IOW, am I better off placing two layers on the middle shelf of the oven 
and the third layer on the top shelf (Of my relatively small oven) and 
switching the layers midway or am I better off baking two layers and 
when those are done the third? Or the third option, dividing the recipe 
and making first two thirds of it in two layers, and then mixing up 1/3 
of the recipe for the third layer (which sounds like a pain in the neck)</p>
<p>Your cake looks gorgeous and I’ve been eyeing it for some time.  I am thinking to make it for a birthday after Passover.</p>

				<p>I made this cake last night for my husband’s birthday today and 
it was my first attempt at a truly homemade cake. It went great! 
Honestly, the hardest part was getting the soft cakes out of the pans 
and peeling off the paper. They were definitely crumbly and fragile, so I
 took the recommendation to freeze them for a time and it was super easy
 to ice them! I am so proud of myself and it looks AMAZING, so I know my
 husband is excited to try it. He specifically requested a peanut butter
 cake and I am thinking I found a winner here. Thank you for posting 
such a delightful recipt and for including helpful tips for guiding 
novices along the way!</p>

				<p>I have been lurking for a couple of months and have tried a few 
recipes that were fantastic. This one, however, was beyond words! I made
 this for my entire family (my parents/sister as well as my in-laws) 
this past weekend. I chose it because my brother-in-law loves peanut 
butter and it was his birthday. Well, I was nervous starting out because
 in my experience chocolate cakes can be very dry but this was ANYTHING 
but! I could not believe how moist and delicious the cake was! The icing
 was also exquisite as well as the ganache (my first time with ganache).
 I served 16 people with this cake. I even gave the last piece to our 
server at the restaurant where we were celebrating and she told me it 
was the best cake she had ever had in her life. Thank you for 
introducing me to this and all of the other wonderful recipes that I 
have found on your site. Your tips have been very valuable as well!!</p>

				<p>My wife is gluten free and doesn’t always get to enjoy treats 
like this. However, I made this cake using gluten flour. It was 
incredible. Very moist, very, delicious, and it looked amazing as well. 
Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. I really appreciated the tips
 on frosting the cake by placing it in the freezer and making a “crumb” 
layer as well. Thanks again!</p>

				<p>I made this cake for my husband’s birthday and it was

Pictures are <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/missda/3452130672/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>In case anyone is wondering: the consistency and flavor of the cake 
itself is very similar to a devil’s food box mix, and since the frosting
 and glaze are so spectacular, I think you could totally get away with 
cake from a mix on this one. (I mention this because I wondered about it
 and decided to go with the recipe for the first try… next time I think 
I’ll try a mix!)</p>

				<p>OMG! I dont even like Peanut Butter… but I couldnt help but lick 
the bowl of frosting…lol… I found this recipe for my fiance’s 40th 
birthday..he is a a reese’s peanut butter cup freak and I think he is 
going to love this cake…If I even let him cut it, It looks to 
perfect!…lol….And can I suggest setting aside a little frosting and a 
little glaze. It makes for a wonderful little treat. Just put some 
frosting on your spoon and dip into the glaze…lol….And remember, this is
 coming from someone who doesnt even like Peanut Butter!</p>

				<p>QUESTION! </p>
<p>After a rousing success with the “Devil Dog Cake” made as a 
traditional layer cake (hoo boy that was CAKE!)  I’m going for THIS cake
 for our next celebration — 2 weeks away. Gotta love back to back 
birthdays. </p>
<p>I’m going to make “Deb’s Favorite Chocolate Cake” recipe again, and 
this time frost and fill with the Peanut Butter Cream Cheese frosting 
from this ensemble. </p>
<p>Piping suggestions for the decoration and the birthday text? I’m kind
 of lost there, I don’t have a chocolate buttercream recipe that I love 
in my back pocket.</p>

				<p>I use whatever frosting contrasts. If you’re doing the ganache 
topping, save a little peanut butter frosting to pipe. If you’re 
skipping the ganache, just make a small amount to chill enough to pipe.</p>

				<p>I made this cake for Easter dinner a few weeks ago and it was 
AMAZING!!! Everyone loved it and I got so many compliments on it! A 
little bit goes a long way too since it’s so rich! It’s also very moist 
which I loved since there is nothing I hate more than a dry cake. I took
 some back with me when I returned to college in a tupperware and it was
 pretty much my breakfast and dessert for the next couple days!</p>

				<p>On measuring peanut butter….yes, there is an easy way.  A 
miraculous, wondrous easy way.  Maybe someone else mentioned this and I 
missed it, but does anyone else have a plunger cup?  Like the ones Alton
 Brown used on Good Eats?  Best. Thing. Ever.  Peanut butter, yogurt, 
corn syrup, honey…all easy peasy.  I paid more than I should have for 
mine at Williams &amp; Sonoma I think, but I’m pretty sure I’ve seen 
them go for around $10.  You just adjust the cup to the level you want 
it (mine has a bunch of different units of measure all the way around it
 to choose from), pack the contents in up to the fill line, just like 
you would with a regular measuring cup, then push in the plunger and 
scrape the bottom of the cup(which is now even with the top, so a flat 
surface).  The plunger-action scrapes the sides for you.  Then the two 
pieces come apart and you can pop it in the dishwasher.  I’m a kitchen 
gadget fiend, but this measuring cup has got to be my favorite.</p>

				<p>Amaaaaazing cake and directions were so easy to follow.  I added a
 touch of expresso powder to the cake batter to enhance the chocolate, 
and also used a combination of cocoa powder and black cocoa powder from 
Baker’s Catalog.  I used two 9 inch pans and made 6 cupcakes with the 
remaining batter.  The cupcakes were a perfect serving–used the large 
chocolate brown tulip cupcake liners from Baker’s Catalog–so pretty! <a href="http://www.kingarthurflour.com/shop/items/tulip-muffin-papers-brown" rel="nofollow">http://www.kingarthurflour.com/shop/items/tulip-muffin-papers-brown</a><br>

				<p>I am a 52 year old wife, mother &amp; grandmother and am known 
for my love of cooking/baking.  I was looking for a recipe for my 
youngest daughters 19th birthday, she asked for a chocolate cake with 
peanut butter frosting.  Wanting to try something new, I got online and 
read countless recipes.  Your recipe for this cake and the picture for 
it caught my attention.  I made this and there wasn’t a crumb left to be
 found.  It is absolutely delicious!  It looks hard but is not at all.  
Just a wee bit more time involved but……oh, sooooo well worth it.  This 
is on the top of my list for favorites now.  Thanks so much for sharing 
it!</p>

				<p>Hi there, just wondering if the water amount is appropriate? I 
followed directions to a t, but the batter was incredibly watery – 
poured right out into the pans without any bowl scraping – and I am now 
at 35 minutes of cooking and not remotely close to done. Complete water 
in the center. Any tips would be appreciated. Thank you!</p>

				<p>I’ve made this cake twice before and it’s become a favorite of my
 friends and family! I do have a question for you though- I was planning
 on making this as cupcakes for a baby shower this weekend, would you 
recomend that I use this cake recipe or another one for the cupcakes? I 
was going to skip over the ganache and just frost the cupcakes, but I’ve
 never had the cake without the ganache, have you? I image it will still
 taste great and no one will thing anything is missing, but I guess I 
just want a second opinion. Thanks for this recipe, it’s fabulous!</p>

				<p>If you scroll through the comments, you can read from dozens of

 it yet. In comment #45, I make two other suggestions of chocolate cakes
 that I like even more, and that can be used with these frostings.</p>

				<p>This cake is delicious.  I just followed your instructions and 
had no trouble.  It’s really not hard.  The cake is soft, but I had no 
trouble freezing it and then frosting, freezing again after a crumb coat
 and then before pouring on the ganache.  Came out beautiful!  It’s very
 rich.  We still finished most of it.  Delicious.  thanks for the great 
recipe.</p>

				<p>Deb – thank you for sharing Alisa Huntsman’s recipe with us! I  
made it for my mom’s birthday today and it was wonderful! I also made 
some banana ice cream (Alton Brown’s recipe) to go along with the thin 
slices and it was a terrific combination.</p>
<p>Quick question though – do you put the ganache on right after 
incorporating the half and half? I’m pretty sure it was a mistake to 
wait a few minutes (which is what I did). It was delicious, just didn’t 
spill over as nicely as yours did. Mine was more like cooling lava – 
very thick LOL ;) Thank you!!!</p>

				<p>Two options: You can let it cool a bit so it thickens or you can 
do as I did, and pour it over a chilled cake. I always chill my frosting
 layers so they set, this slows down the dribbling (I mention this in 
step 4). I think the second option is the better way to go. I have other
 cake tips in <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2009/03/layer-cake-tips-the-biggest-birthday-cake-yet/" rel="nofollow">this post</a>.</p>

				<p>I just made my first post on my new blog and it was all about 
this cake that I made for my 25th birthday. I’d been wanting to make it 
since you posted it originally. Since I’m new to the blogging scene and I
 don’t know the etiquette. I just wanted to let you know I’d used your 
recipe on my blog, and make sure its cool with you. I know I’ll be 
wanting to site you in the future since you’re one of my main go-to’s 
for good recipes. thanks so much for what you’re doing! And if you have 
any advice for starting up a blog I’d love to hear it. </p>
<p>My attempt of the recipe went really well and I had rave reviews from
 my guests, I’m still getting them actually. It works well with just two
 layers also. I only had two pans to work with at the time. Needless to 
say its kind to the eyes, tongue and the belly!</p>

				<p>I just made this cake yesterday and it was a big hit.  You’re 
right, it’s VERY rich and one sliver at a time is best.  I had no 
problem with the bread, I placed it in the freezer for about 30 mns to 
set up before frosting.  The ganache was not as “runny” as I would have 
liked it and so it didn’t run down the sides as nice as your pics, but I
 helped it along and it turned out great.  Thank you for posting such a 
beautiful recipe-I’ve already ordered Sky High!</p>

made him so very happy, it was absolutely gorgeous, and I think it will 
be a favorite to make again and again. It tasted great too, although I 
accidentally used powdered sugar in the cake instead of granulated. I 
was going to throw it out, but I decided to try a bite (by slicing off a
 tiny bit of an uneven layer). So glad I didn’t! Delicious!!</p>

and then the decision was made.  I did substitute almond butter, and it 
worked great.  I may have to try it with peanut butter sometime, but for
 my tastes the almond butter would be hard to beat.  <a href="http://nlbarber.livejournal.com/184515.html" rel="nofollow">LJ entry with photos</a></p>

and takes alot of time to make I cooled it crumb coated the cake each 
layer stuck in freezer to cool and then frosted and stacked stuck it 
back in the freezer to get hard then the chocalate and back in the 
freezer but let me tell ya it looked like it came from a bakery and 
tasted like it to definately a keeper<br>

				<p>Ok, even though there are already 408 comments, I have to 
comment! This cake was seriously amazing. Yes, rich. Hello, that is not a
 problem – its cake! With frosting and ganache! I am actually most 
impressed with how moist the cake was – that always seems to be the 
hardest thing about cakes. </p>
<p>It was made for my husband’s birthday last Saturday and I think I’ve 
eaten a piece every day since then. We clearly need more friends!</p>

				<p>This is amasing!!! First time I didn`t have too much time on my 
hand so made cake out of box but used this frosting and chocolate glaze –
 it was still amasing. Today I will make a whole thing. Everybody loved 
it!!!</p>

				<p>My mom made me this cake for my birthday last year and it was 
amazing! I can still taste the moist,chocolatey,warm, cake and the 
rich,creamy,peanutbutter filling. It’s so good it’ll be like your 
tastebuds took a detour and ended up in paradise! And when the slice is 
done you can’t resist reaching over and having another! So go ahead,make
 some. Just make sure you tell your friends. Bon Appatite!</p>

				<p>Hi Deb, 2 questions, rather 2 parts of the same – What does the 
vinegar do to the cake and what is the role of the corn syrup? Can I 
replace them or simply skip? I am not very comfortable using these, but 
if you suggest they are ‘musts’, would just have to stock up my shelves.</p>

				<p>You are of course welcome to tweak the recipe any way you see 
fit, but it works fantastically as it is. The vinegar adds an excellent 
depth of flavor (think buttermilk versus regular milk, always better in 
baking). Corn syrup is an invert sugar, it works smoothly in ways that 
regular sugar does not. There’s no reason to be uncomfortable with it — 
it’s not like we’re talking about (gasp!) HFCS, a totally different 
beast. You can read more about why it works best sometimes <a href="http://www.davidlebovitz.com/archives/2009/01/why_and_when_to_use_or_not_use_c.html" rel="nofollow">over here</a>.</p>

				<p>Deb – I made this yesterday for my boyfriend’s birthday.  He too 
is a peanut butter addict.  Man was it good and super rich.  It’s the 
kind of cake that you get to the last few bites and don’t think you can 
finish but then just bite the bullet:)  Thanks for the great recipe.  
Now we will have cake for days…</p>

				<p>Haha, true.. it’s just that never used these ingredients 
earlier.. but you gave the boost with the prompt reply. Thanks a lot. 
Preparing to try this out soon.</p>
<p>PS: Your strawberries and dumplings have become so much regular in my
 kitchen this summer, at least once a week. Easy and delicious. So are 
the pizzas and tarts. I am a self learner (internet based, so to say), 
and you are doing a wonderful job. And 100 percent dependable. Thanks

				<p>I saw this recipe and thought that I just had to try it… yep 
another peanut butter and chocolate addict here!!  Anyways, I had a 
little mishap with one of the cakes due to how moist and soft they are. 
Instead of getting upset like I wanted to do, I threw the mangled cake 
in a trifle bowl, then I thought “hey why not just make the whole thing 
into a trifle!” I layered it the same way as I would have with the 
original cake and it turned out to be perfect! Who would have guessed my
 oops would end so well!</p>

   It was also ‘officially’ requested for next year. It is extremely

				<p>After seeing this cake, i immediately bought the Sky High Cakes 
cookbook. Its amazing! I just made this choc pb cake this weekend and it
 was, of course, absolutely delicious! moist and rich and addictive. I 
accidently only bought 4 oz of chocolate for the ganache and didnt have 
enough time to buy more, so i just went with it. Turned out better than i
 think it would of if i had used the correct amount! It spread and 
dripped perfectly, i know people were having trouble with it being too 
thick so i think this is the secret! 4 oz semi sweet choc and the same 
amount of the rest of ingredients. hope that helps!</p>

				<p>This was great to have a recipe that was so easy to follow! 
Everything went perfectly. I don’t have anything new to add, except that
 I’m not sure what to do with the rest of it! It’s like one cake is 
enough to feed an army! It’s like lembus bread: you can eat a bite and 
be set all day long.<br>

				<p>It seems like every time I post a comment here, I am saying the same thing.</p>
<p>BUT, thank you for posting this.  I think this was the best thing I have ever baked!</p>
<p>I only made two layers because I don’t have 3 cake pans, but I am 
more fond of cake than frosting, so I loved the extra thick layers of 
perfect chocolate cake.</p>
<p>I have a good amount of leftover frosting, so I may make a little 
cake this weekend and just have it with the frosting, if it keeps.</p>

				<p>AMAZING! I made this as cupcakes. I cut the cake and frosting 
recipe in half. The glaze was delicious, but I thought it was too messy 
for the cupcakes, so I left it off. Someday I’ll make the cake in it’s 
entirety, but the cupcakes with just the frosting are delicious. I’m a 
huge peanut butter/chocolate fan and this is a very grown-up and 
decadent version of my favorite combination. Oh, and one cupcake will 
knock you out! Thank you, I love your site!!!</p>

				<p>I made this cake for a friend’s graduation party in late June. I 
was lucky to pull it off, because an enormous (ENORMOUS) storm knocked 
out the power for days. I had made the layers in advance and stored them
 in the freezer, and I didn’t need electricity for the frosting, but had
 to go to a friend’s house while she was in the middle of moving to make
 the icing and assemble the thing. It was rather monstrous to handle and
 nearly reduced me to tears while my friend’s brothers lurked in the 
shadows for dropped crumbs.<br>
Regardless, the cake was BEAUTIFUL to behold and absolutely DELICIOUS. 
It was a huge hit and some people said it was the best cake they’d ever 
eaten :)</p>

				<p>Second, I was going to make it for a block party this coming 
weekend, but I got to thinking that it might be easier to eat as 
cupcakes.  What do you think about doing it kind-of like your Irish 
cupcakes where you core out a bit in the center for the ganache and then
 frost over it with the regular peanut butter frosting?  Do you think 
the cake will hold up for that?  I remember the cake being crumbly.  Any
 thoughts would be appreciated.</p>

				<p>Holy hell. This cake is fantastic. I am definitely not a baker … I
 clicked on this via your espresso cake post just before my husband’s 
birthday (who could -and used to- live on peanut butter) and thought, 
‘ok, let’s do it.’ We just happened to have received a care package of 
homemade peanut brittle from my mom (with secret ingredient puffy rice 
paper layer, I know!). After being confused to find not just one or 
three but 4 (four!) cake pans in the depths of my cupboard, one of the 
cakes got stuck so it ended up a two-layer masterpiece. The ganache 
spread &amp; dripped just right (also chilled the cake a bit). My 
husband said it was his best birthday cake ever &amp; I was incredibly 
happy to succeed at my first “real” cake! Yes, so super-duper-rich but 
absolutely delicious. Second on serving slivers though with plenty o’ 
milk. :) I also shared a piece with our landlords who deemed it 
restaurant-worthy. Yay!!! Thank you AGAIN Deb!</p>

 recipe I tried &amp; it came out WONDERFUL! My family loved it. I 
followed your recipe, the pictures &amp; instructions were right on. I 
did bake the cake in two 9″ rounds vs the three 8″. Saw were some people
 said the cake was so fluffy it was unsteady while icing so since I 
didn’t have three 8″ rounds I did the 9″ with great turn out. Thanks for
 giving us a new family favorite.</p>

 in?</p>

Made this cake on Mon night for my husband’s bday yesterday! Many of our
 guests said it was the best cake they have ever eaten! Thanks for 
sharing!</p>
<p>I made the cake then crumb coated &amp; frosted on Mon night, 
refrigerated overnight , then put on the choc glaze just before the 
party. I topped it with quarters of Reese’s PB cups for decoration… But I
 am MOST grateful for your suggestion to serve it in smaller wedges – it
 is so rich &amp; yummy – after cutting a large piece for my husband, I 
served 24 people this cake!</p>

<p>Also my choc glaze was a bit fin as I onlt had 200g of Choc, and

<p>But looks amazing!</p>

				<p>This cake absolutely flew together– one of the easiest 
multi-frosting cakes I’ve ever made without a mix. And it is AMAZING. 
Even cutting quarter-inch slices and serving with tall glasses of milk 
and cups of black coffee does *nothing* to cut the overwhelming 
sweetness. Gorgeous, delicious, and likely to feed all my neighbors as 
well. Thank you for the recipe!</p>

				<p>Forgive my ignorance, but are we supposed to use UNSWEETENED or 
SWEETENED peanut butter (I get the “commercial” and the “hydrogenated” 
in order to prevent separation, but it’s not obvious to me if this means
 commercial like the sweetened stuff my parents never let me eat or not.
  Sky High, which I happily own, doesn’t make this explicit either.)  
Thanks so much for your help.</p>

				<p>I have never seen peanut butter labeled as sweetened or

small amount of sugar in it. So, yes, I guess “sweetened” then.</p>

				<p>Made this for a friend’s birthday, and then brought the leftovers
 to the office.  People went absolutely apesh*t.  There was a line down 
the hall to get one of the remaining slivers.  People have offered to 
pay me to make it again.</p>
<p>Couple of notes from me.  I would have made more frosting, getting it
 completely covered was difficult near the end, another cup or so would 
have been handy.  I used the Reese’s peanut butter and Hershey’s 
chocolate, which made it a true peanut butter cup flavour (which I 
love).  Lastly, I cannot agree enough with the note to chill the cake 
before frosting it and then before glazing it… it I hadn’t it would have
 been a nightmare.</p>

				<p>I made this cake over three days, I baked the cake layers on 
Tuesday night, froze them and then made the frosting and layered the 
cake on Wednesday night and let it sit in the fridge till this morning 
(Thursday) when I made the chocolate ganache and poured it over. The 
ganache had a wonderful consistency and the way it  poured over the cake
 was beautiful. We’re eating the cake for my brother’s birthday tonight 
and I’m looking forward to tasting it!</p>
<p>Alison, I made the frosting with unsweetened peanut butter (and cut down on 2 cups of the sugar) and it was fine.</p>
<p>Deb, I found my cake layers each had a slightly darker, moist looking
 area in the centre even though they were fully baked and a cake tester 
came out clean. Did I do something wrong with the way I mixed the 
batter? I don’t think it will affect the taste though.</p>

				<p>I made this for my sister-in-law’s birthday and it was amazing. I
 made it as a two-layer cake because I only have two pans and it still 
worked flawlessly. You made me look like an incredible baker today, and 
for that I thank you!</p>

make.  Last night was my friends 21st birthday, and there is nothing she
 loves more than chocolate and peanut butter.  Let me tell you, if I 
hadn’t come across this recipe I would have been lost.  THANK YOU!!  It 
was freakin’ amazing!!</p>

				<p>I just have to let you know that I found this recepie last year 
right before my peanut butter and chocolate obsessed boyfriends 
birthday- and my entire family rejoiced after eating this cake. We all 
loved it SO much that it has now become a tradition to make it on his 
birthday. I can say we will be eating it on that day for the rest of our
 lives since he just became my fiance (and I’m sure it’s partly because 
of this cake recepie LOL!) THANK YOU FOR SHARING!!!!!! It is very time 
consuming, but the end result is nothing short of the best cake I have 
EVER tasted!</p>

				<p>Interesting that this recipe calls for vinegar, baking soda AND 
eggs. I thought vinegar and baking soda were an egg replacement. I’ve 
seen many eggless chocolate cakes that include vinegar. Any idea what 
purpose the vinegar serves here? Just makes the cake extra springy? More
 moist?</p>

from the bakery…:) Yeah…for my daughter’s boyfriends BDay this

				<p>First of all, I love your blog! SO many great recipes with such 
great photos that I sit here and lick the screen on a daily basis ;)</p>
<p>I made this cake last weekend and absolutely loved it! It is SOOO 
GOOOD. Thank you so much for posting this recipe :) My cake doesn’t look
 nearly as good as yours, but I tried haha. You can see my sorry attempt
 here: <a href="http://eclecticsamya.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://eclecticsamya.blogspot.com/</a></p>
<p>On my post I said that this cake was special to the holiday I was celebrating, but I think I’ll be making it very very soon!</p>
<p>Thanks! And never stop blogging, please.</p>

				<p>I made this cake today exactly as written.  It’s a peanut butter 
cup lovers, dream cake!   It is so very, very good.  The cake itself is 
so moist and tender.  That was good advice about chilling the cake to 
firm it before putting on the crumb coat.  I also brushed the loose 
crumbs off with a pastry brush before chilling.  The peanut butter and 
cream cheese frosting was delicious.   I’d have never imagined that 
combo, but the peanut butter flavor was good and pronounced in it.   The
 ganache was also delicious with just enough PB flavor to remind you of a
 peanut butter cup.  I have the book, but thought I’d reviewthe recipe 
here since this is where I initially picked up the recipe.  Thanks, Deb.</p>

				<p>I made this cake for my Mom’s 75th birthday.  What a hit!  A less
 mature birthday girl might have been jealous of the attention it 
received! </p>
<p>I have to agree, though, that this is a very moist cake.  Without 
placing it in the freezer / frig along the way, the construction would 
have been a lot more fussy.  My ganache seized up (at this point I had 
too many helpers in the kitchen!) so I heated the cream and added it to 
the chocolate/PB mixture.  Smoothed out nicely.<br>
I made fondant leaves in fall colors ahead of time and scattered them 
around the top edge.  It looked almost as good as it tasted!</p>

				<p>I’ve made this cake before. It was my first attempt at layer 
cakes (and a massive disaster, btw) but I promised myself I’d try it 
again and am planning on baking it for my birthday next Saturday.</p>
<p>I have one question about confectioner’s sugar/powdered sugar in 
frosting. When I add sugar (it says powdered sugar on the box) I get a 
mildly crunchy taste in the frosting. This has happened every time 
(cupcakes, cakes, cookies). Everyone ends up saying I used too much 
sugar, but I always use the amount in the recipe. Is it because I’m not 
beating it enough and it’s no dissolved or am I really using too much 
sugar? </p>
<p>Would love to get this cake right for my birthday, so anyone who can offer advice is welcome to comment.</p>

				<p>Powdered sugar frostings do get a crust on them after drying out for some time. It’s just the nature of the ingredient.</p>

				<p>I have made this cake twice &amp; it was a huge hit both times.  I
 baked the cakes one night, iced it the next &amp; served it the next 
day.  I kept it in the fridge in containers.  It was delicious!  And 
since it got to sit for a while all iced the flavors really melded 
together.  It is a very moist cake &amp; can easily fall apart, but just
 take your time – it is worth it!</p>

				<p>I’ve had birthday cake success with this cake two years in a row.
 This year I read the directions better and it was a lot easier. The 
freezing part: essential. Wax paper on the bottom: life saver.</p>
<p>I made it as a two layer and used the leftover batter to make a mini two later cake, by baking the leftovers in ramekins.</p>

				<p>I’ve been wanting to make this cake for a long time and it is in 
the oven at this very moment…  However, I am dubious about my success.  
That is a LOT of water and this is by far, the thinnest “cake” batter 
I’ve ever made.  I can’t imagine how two lowly eggs are going to thicken
 this batter.  Sigh.</p>

				<p>I used unsweetened peanut butter with great success, but I think 
the trick to avoid the oil separation is to use fresh pressed not 
something that has spent months sitting around in a jar.  The 
consistency was a bit chunky, but everyone who ate it was pleased with 
the results.  I ended up making two layers and cupcakes with the extra 
batter.  Maybe next time I’ll have another cake pan or not be too scared
 to assemble and frost a three layer cake.  Deb, your frosting tips and 
recipe advice are most excellent!</p>

				<p>Ooops, I forgot to mention that I only used four cups on sugar in
 the frosting, and it  was still plenty sweet (even with the unsweetened
 peanut butter).  I think I may only use three cups next time.</p>

				<p>This is AMAZING. I have entered our church bake off the past 3 
years and have only come in 3rd or not placed at all. Determined to win 
this year I ran across this recipe last minute and was so thankful. 
First place ! I would agree with doing the ‘crumb layer’ , it was hard 
to frost without it. I also used regular chocolate chips instead of semi
 sweet. Either way its a great recipe, thanks!</p>

				<p>My very kind co-worker and friend made this for me for my 
birthday and OMG DELICIOUS. The cake was so moist the peanutbutter 
filling was not sweet but fantastic in it’s own right and the chocolate 
glaze topping pulled the whole thing together in a wonderfully playful 
dance in my mouth. As I have not been able to stop talking about this 
cake my family is insisting I make it for Thanksgiving. Not sure I can

				<p>Easily the best cake I’ve ever made in my entire life.</p>
<p>Since my husband *glare* left one of my cake pans at his work, I only
 had 2 and made a double layer cake instead. Worked out fine, but 
possibly led to one of the best problems I’ve ever had in my entire 
life…</p>
<p>Nearly 2 cups of left over peanut butter frosting…</p>
<p>I’m thinking cupcakes ;) Actually I’m thinking about using it in your oreo recipe…</p>
<p>thanks SO MUCH for the recipe, it made my husband’s 30th just fantastic.</p>

				<p>I made this cake twice in 2 days, thanks to a bonehead moment on 
my part!  (Forgot to add the baking soda the first time around.  
Zoinks!)</p>
<p>Since I used disposables for disastrous attempt #1, I had to cheat 
and make my 2nd try in a 9 x 13 cake pan.  It needed an extra 12-15 
minutes of baking time, but it came out fine.  </p>
<p>Actually, I think “divine” was the word of choice!  :o)</p>

				<p>I believe the solution to the crumbly overly moist cake is to cut
 back the water by 1/2 cup. I have not tried this yet, but I believe 
that the cake recipe has way too much liquid in it.  I have just 
finished  baking the cake, and have allowed it to cool completely and 
the cake is literally falling apart and sticking to the cooling rack.  
The flavor of the cake is wonderful . . . it is just the texture that 
needs a little fixing.</p>

				<p>Lauren Lincoln, I haven’t had that problem with this cake. I had 
to make the cake mixture twice though, because it just wasn’t enough for
 the pans. I could only really fill my smallest pan once with it, which 
sucked.</p>

				<p>LOVED the cake… served it for New Year’s Day and everybody raved 
about the cake AND my baking abilities (thank you smittenkitchen) but I 
couldn’t taste the peanut butter in the filling. I admit I added 1 less 
cup of powdered sugar– could that have reduced the peanut butter’s 
intensity?</p>

				<p>Made this cake for New Year’s Eve.  I was concerned about 
spending so much time on a nice cake for a bunch of 20-somethings who 
were … uhm … enjoying their champagne, but everyone was blown away.  My 
boyfriend said (not to tell his mother) that it’s the best cake he ever 
had, and one of his friends will not stop talking about it.  Amazing, 
amazing cake!</p>
<p>Also, Carol — I wonder if the sugar would make a difference, because 
maybe there would still be a strong cream cheese taste?  It could have 
also been the peanut butter.  I used Jif Natural Creamy, and that peanut
 butter is VERY peanut-y and not very sweet, so it worked really well in
 the frosting. Just a thought!</p>

				<p>Since I am on a commenting streak, I had to come to this page and
 let you know how I did. THIS WAS A FRIGGIN HIT. Luckily, I make a tiny 
pan for myself, or I wouldn’t have had any. I just added chocolate 
mousse (the easy no egg kind) into the layers along with the peanut 
butter frosting. I doubled the recipe and it was GINORMOUS. But 
delicious. and rich. it hurt my belly after I was done. . .it also hurt 
my feet when I got up to get some more…</p>

the great recipies.  I baked/decorated Wedding and special occasions 
cakes when I lived in California<br>
(and was some 40 years younger…I’m now 75)  I still keep looking for new
 recipies in every catagory as I entertain a great deal still. I

				<p>I just made this today for my graduate school get-together and it
 was a huge hit. There was one sliver left and everyone couldn’t believe
 I made it instead of my mother. I would definitely recommend sticking 
the layers in the freezer for a while, it would have been much easier to
 handle. Oh and make more frosting than called for, I started to run low
 near the end. I’m not sure if its from too much coverage or from my mom
 and sister sabotaging me by sneaking spoonfuls out of my mixing bowl.</p>

				<p>I made this for my boyfriends birthday, it was amazing. I ended 
up with more chocolate glaze so I covered the whole thing. I did burn 
one of the layers a little (our oven can be a bit mental at times) and 
thought I’d spoiled the entire cake…but it turned out fine and the two

this cake several more times (like tomorrow)… I love it… I’m not sure if
 my convection on my oven wasn’t working or not but the cakes baked 
uneven… puffy on the perimeter and sunken in the middle…  I evened them 
out with frosting! SOOOOO GOOD! I LOVE THIS CAKE! I wanted to make a 
peanut butter, chocolate cake so I googled and this fit the bill!</p>

				<p>Hi, sorry in advance if someone asked this already. I tried my 
best to screen, but 500 comments are quite a bit to scan through, so 
it’s definitely possible I missed it. </p>
<p>In you cake tips section you recommended baking cakes at 300 degrees 
so they would be flatter and easier to trim. This recipe listed the 
baking time as 350 and I tend to be horrid with temperatures; I always 
over or under bake slightly. Needless to say the idea of guesstimating 
how long to bake this cake for terrifies me. I was wondering if you 
could recommend a jumping off point, so to speak, for how long I should 
bake this cake. </p>
<p>Thanks so much, and sorry if this is a stupid/previously answered question,<br>

				<p>This is definitely the best cake I’ve ever made or even eaten for
 that matter. Only problem I have is, it broke into 3 overnight! It 
seems like my cake rounds didn’t flatten so overnight it slowly slid 
apart. It seemed so beautiful, if only for a day.<br>
Deb, do you have any tips on how to keep that from happening? The only 
thing I didn’t do was cool the cakes on a wire rack, and instead did it 
on a plate. Should that keep it from happening? Thanks for this amazing

				<p>I’m not sure I followed… did they split once stacked and iced? If
 so, then you would want to level the cakes before you stack them, so 
they’re not “bending” as they are stacked on top of a curved top.</p>

				<p>The cake split once it was stacked and iced because the tops of 
all 3 layers remained rounded. What is the best way to level the tops 
before stacking them? Squashing the round down or cutting it flat. I 
figure it would of flattened out if I had used a wire rack while 
cooling, as opposed to a dinner plate. Could the layers just be more 
rounded than they should of been from a mixing error?</p>

<p>I usually cut mine flat the best I can. Or, my grandmother uses a

				<p>Hi Charles — No squishing; the cake will always want to bounce 
back. You can use a long, serrated knife (or even a piece of non-minty 
dental floss, a trick I have picked up from readers) to bevel the tops 
of the cakes so that they will be flat. I’ve got more tips like this in <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2009/03/layer-cake-tips-the-biggest-birthday-cake-yet/" rel="nofollow">this post.</a></p>

				<p>I think I was potentially cursed when I was making this ganache —
 I burned no less than 4 batches. Four! I’m not even sure how that’s 
possible. I tried a double boiler, a glass bowl over a pot of boiling 
water, a plastic bowl held six inches above a pot of boiling water, and 
the microwave in ten second intervals. It went from slightly melted to a
 glue-y, dull mess in ten seconds flat.</p>
<p>Eventually, I heated up the half and half and used the residual heat 
from that to melt the chocolate, and that finally did the trick. It had 
to have been the chocolate I was using, right? The first two batches 
were made with Ghirardelli bars, and the second two were made with 
Ghirardelli chips. I’ll have to try this again with a higher quality bar
 (or, you know, never attempt it again because obviously the gods don’t 
want me making it).</p>

				<p>This cake is amazing. I agree that making the frosting a little 
saltier is a plus –  also I made it once with Jif and once with fresh 
ground roasted peanut butter from whole foods and it was waaay better 
the second time. I think the brittle on top gives a nice crunch, and 
might even try mixing it into the frosting that goes between the layers.
 I also made this into cupcakes. The batter made a little less than 2 
dozen, filled to the top.  I let the ganache cool a bit and spread it on
 top of the cupcakes, then refrigerated them and piped on the frosting 
when they were set, sprinkling some brittle on top. Amazing!</p>

				<p>Just made this. There are no words.<br>
I couldn’t assemble it because I demolished a considerable slice of one 
of the layers straight out of the pan shmeared with a good 1/4 cup of 
the oozy, nutty icing. I am in sheer bliss. Off to finish the rest of 
that pan…</p>

				<p>I make this for my husband’s birthday last week.  I don’t think 
I’ve made a birthday for him in about 5 years. (I am perpetuating the 
rumor that I hate baking…it  saves me a lot of time and aggravation). 
His favorite candy is Reese’s peanut butter cups.  he even steals them 
from our kids at Halloween.  This cake was just the ticket!  He loves 
it.  It was easy.  I didn’t even break out the kitchen aide.  I have 
been trying to convince him to give some to our neighbors to remove the 
temptation from our house but he won’t part with any.  I think if I had 
this recipe in my arsenal when we were dating, we would have been 
married much sooner!  I topped our cake with toffee coated peanuts — 
yummy.</p>

				<p>I saw above that you used 9-inch cake pans – that’s what I’m 
trying at the moment, however my cakes are turning out … somewhat less 
than high &amp; fluffy – the pic that you’ve got of the slice of cake is
 at an angle so it makes it hard for me to see, but roughly how high did
 your layers come out?</p>

				<p>My layers were maybe an inch or so tall each. The total cake with
 all of that filling and ganache was pretty tall, however. I remember it
 bumping into the top of the cake box!</p>
<p>C Ho — Just check the volumes of your heart-shaped pans. Compare them
 to the volume of an 8- or 9-inch round and adjust the recipe 
accordingly. </p>

				<p>This is one of the most amazing cakes I’ve ever made.  I didn’t 
top it with the chocolate ganache since it was for a low key afternoon 
lunch with friends, and it was still out of this world. I can’t wait to 
use this frosting on cupcakes.  It is SO good.  I had some leftover and 
ate by the spoonful all week.</p>

				<p>Wow…I’ve been keeping this one in the back of my mind ever since I
 read about it. My husband thinks peanut butter was created on the 8th 
Day, and I was just waiting for a chance to surprise him with this…so 
yesterday was Valentine’s of course, and I DID IT. </p>
<p>Oh…My…Sweet…Lord…</p>
<p>Turned out just like the pics (HUZZAH!!!) and was just as excruciatingly delicious as promised.</p>

				<p>I am a little late to this party, but I must concur with the 
comment about using commercial PB.  I only buy organic because I can’t 
in good concious buy a commercial brand knowing all the other 
ingredients/chemicals they put in it when the only one should be 
peanuts.  That being said my frosting tasted delicious but was not light
 and fluffy after adding the PB and was difficult to to ice with and 
ended up looking like a child’s play doh project.  Even though I 
thoroughly mixed the PB so there was no separation it was still flat and
 hard to work.  Thank God for the Ganache to hide all the ugliness.<br>
Cake is delicious and getting wonderful reviews.</p>

				<p>Thank you, Deb! I love your website and have tried many of your 
recipes – they’re all so good!! I came across this cake just after my 
roommate had asked me what kind of cake I wanted for my birthday. I 
immediately showed it to her (and everyone else I knew!). I was so 
excited about this cake that I wondered if I’d be let down. Nope – it 
lived up to its expectations! It was pure peanut butter/chocolate 
birthday bliss! :)</p>

				<p>hi deb… just wondering if I can substitute whipping cream (35%) 
instead of using half &amp; half for the chocolate-peanut butter glaze… i
 ask only because I have a bunch of whipping cream to use up in the 
fridge… i definitely don’t mind getting (or concotting) the half &amp; 
half if you think using whipping cream instead is ill-advised… looking 
forward to making this cake for my husband’s birthday next week… thanks 
again for a terrific website and recipes…</p>

				<p>Although I have been a reader for about a year now, I made this 
over the weekend as my first recipe off the site, and it was beyond 
delicious. I brought it to a party and it was a huge, huge hit!!! 
Everything about this thing is rich and peanut buttery and wonderful. 
And the cake really is one bowl. I was shocked. </p>
<p>I don’t know if I read more for the food or the baby now. I keep 
telling my friend if she can manage to have one as cute I will quit my 
job as an accountant and be her full time nanny. Jacob is seriously the 
cutest kid I have ever seen. Ever.</p>

				<p>Wondering if this cake can be stored at room temp in a glass 
covered cake plate?  It’s already chilled and set in the fridge for 30 
minutes, the glaze looks perfect, but wondering now if I can keep it at 
room temperature or if it’s supposed to be kept in fridge all the time 
except for serving.  </p>
<p>This recipe is to die for, and very user friendly, I thought.  Thank you so much for sharing!</p>

try out out on my mom’s birthday first — just made it today, and it 
turned out beautifully!  </p>

				<p>Deb!  Would like to start by saying thank you so much for sharing
 so many wonderful recipes with us.  This blog is freaking amazing.  I 
enjoy it and your thoroughly NYC tone immensely.  Your son is also 
gorgeous beyond words, your photies of Mr J make my hormones go through 
the roof, lady!  Those cheeks and mop of hair are the best thing you’ve 
baked.</p>
<p>I finally got around to making this cake, although being short on 
time, I went the cupcake route.  I slightly hollowed them out, filled 
with the peanut butter stuff, pipped more peanut butter stuff on top, 
then pooled over some of the chocolate stuff.  This recipe yields the 
most ridiculously amazing cake EVER, and I bake a minimum of weekly.  I 
have also replaced my standard chocolate cake with this version.  I have
 gotten non stop raves, even from those who claim to hate either 
chocolate (whaaaa?) and/or peanut butter, so, thank you very much!</p>

				<p>Made this cake yesterday for a friends birthday. </p>
<p>It was the first time I’ve ever made a layer cake. Not too hard! </p>
<p>My only advice is that you have to work fast with the ganache. I read
 the tips on spreading it over a cold cake for the gooey look, but I 
think I was too cautious and moved too slowly, so it didn’t drizzle 
quite as nicely. I’ll remember it for next time. </p>
<p>Very moist, everyone loved it.</p>

				<p>I just made this cake for my dad’s birthday, and it was so well 
received I’ve been told I have to make it for his birthday every year.</p>
<p>I used Yoghurt instead of Sour Cream, and cut the icing sugar in the 
frosting down to just 2 cups.  As well, I used Kraft Natural Peanut 
butter and didn’t have any problems with the frosting being too thick.</p>
<p>I also used two rectangular glass pyrex dishes to make this into a 2 layer cake, and baked it for 35 minutes.  </p>
<p>All of these substitutions still resulted in something that is to die for.</p>

 I had a good feeling it would win.  I can’t tell you how many kudos I

				<p>I made this yesterday for my best friend’s 20th birthday and it 
was UNBELIEVABLE. I used coffee and instead of water and eliminated the 
vinegar. The cake was so moist (definitely a good idea to refrigerate or
 freeze the layers before frosting), and the frosting was delicious. The
 ganache was perfect, like eating fudge. Such a cool presentation also, 
everyone was impressed. I bake constantly and everyone said this was 
their favorite thing I’ve ever made. I will make this again and again 
and again.</p>

				<p>I cannot tell you how many people loved this cake. I made it 
twice in one week–first as a practice round for a friend’s birthday, 
then for the actual birthday party. Friends, neighbors, 
colleagues–everyone RAVED about it. For days. Weeks. I still have people
 mentioning it to me. It has given me newfound baking confidence, and I 
really appreciate you sharing this recipe!</p>
<p>Now for the bad news: The cake takes a lot longer to bake than the 
recipe indicates (20-30mins more), and the center falls in. Both times I
 checked the cake at the appropriate time that it was supposed to come 
out, and the center was still practically liquid. It was in that last 
20-30mins that the center sinks. I checked, and my oven temp is 
accurate. I also mixed the batter thoroughly. I’m baking in two 9″ round
 pans on the center rack.</p>
<p>I did a quick search above and didn’t see anyone else with the same 
issue, but I’m hoping there’s someone out there who can offer advice…?</p>

				<p>I made this cake a couple weeks ago and let me tell you it was 
perfect.  I did it in 3 9-inch cake pans (would you believe Target 
doesn’t sell 8 inch cake pans?  WTF?).  I do believe the words “tastiest
 food item of the night, nay year” and “you’ve ruined baked goods for 
me” were uttered.  Of course I have to find something to make for the 
NEXT birthday in the lineup but I’m sure I’ll work something out… and

				<p>I just made this cake for my friend’s birthday party and it was 
an absolute hit!! It is a very time consuming cake, but completely worth
 the effort. The directions were all very helpful. My only comment is 
that I think you meant that you should use 1/3 of the icing when doing 
the first layer, instead of 2/3. Thanks for such an amazing recipe!! 
Keep ‘em comin’! :)</p>

				<p>My son had requested a Peanut-Butter / Chocolate / Pretzel Cake 
for his birthday. I made this cake and sprinkled broken Pretzel Sticks 
over the top and then added unbroken (small) Pretzel Sticks standing up /
 leaning on each other all over the top for a striking appearance. </p>
<p>We had it last night to rave reviews. My daughter said she looked at 
the piece on her plate and thought she couldn’t eat it all, then after 
trying it decided she could very well eat the whole cake. </p>
<p>The cake is fabulous and will become one of my regular celebration 
cakes, with or without the pretzels, although the saltiness was a nice 
countertpoint to that rich, rich cake.</p>

				<p>I just made this decadant cake to take to Easter Supper tomorrow 
with my family. My Aunt who is hosting the dinner requested Choc w. PB 
frosting -her favorite. For how much I bake (weekly) I have never ever 
made PB frosting. LOL. I am liiterally just finishing up the cake now 
and am sad I am going to have to share ;) Thanks for a rich and decadant
 dessert that I am sure to be making again!</p>
<p>Happy Spring!!</p>

				<p>I’m making this cake right now to take over for my boyfriend’s 
mom’s 50th birthday party tonight. We’re having lobster and Prosecco, 
but I’m thinking this over-the-top cake might overshadow everything 
else. Nom nom!</p>
<p>@Kristi (commenter 561) – the recipe says 2/3 cup of frosting, not 2/3 of all the frosting. :)</p>

				<p>Holy cats! This cake is good. Or actually, I think it’s the 
combination of cake and frosting that makes it so perfect. I found 
myself wanting the cake to have a bit more oomph…a chocolatier flavor? 
More salt? I often think this about oil-based cake recipes versus 
butter-based ones, but I also concede that this cake is SUPER-RICH as it
 is and doing a butter-based cake might push it over the edge.</p>
<p>As usual, I made changes:</p>
<p>Batter:<br>
– 1/4 cup less sugar<br>
– 1/4 cup less water<br>
– 1 teaspoon more vanilla<br>
– extra pinch of salt</p>
<p>Frosting:<br>
– used salted butter<br>
– 11 oz cream cheese<br>
– 1 cup or more pb, and I DID use a grainy, salted, natural brand (Adams)<br>
– added 2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br>
– a few extra pinches of salt</p>
<p>I kept pb out of the ganache and topped the cake with chopped, 
roasted salted peanuts. Freezing the layers is very good idea. MAKE SURE
 TO CHECK IF YOUR OIL IS FRESH! Mine was rancid and I had to bake a 
second cake….. but it was totally worth the sleep deprivation. 
Seriously. This might be the most deliciously Reese’s PB Cup-like cake, 
or ANY kind of cake, I’ve ever eaten. MAKE IT NOW, before it’s too 
late!!!!</p>

				<p>Do you think by chance that I could use mashed bananas in place 
of the oil????  I’m looking for a banana chocolate cake with pb frosting
 or some sort of combo like that.  Guess I could try…. just curious.  
Looks wonderful!</p>

				<p>Hi Deb</p>

 I did today, after baking the cake, when I turned over the cake, the 
whole cake fell apart. Where did I go wrong?</p>

				<p>Can you give me more info? Did it break because it was soft?

				<p>Thanks for responding fast Deb. The cake tasted perfect but whenever aft baking,<br>
when inverted onto wire rack and peel off the paper liner, the cake 
cracks and opens up. Otherwise, the cake is fine. I did the cake 3 X

birthday cake after all) even though he was still stuffed from dinner. </p>
<p>And you’re definitely right about the cake feeding a lot more people 
than 12. We barely made a dent, so he’s taking half the cake to feed his
 colleagues at work today. Thanks for a great recipe!</p>

				<p>We don’t keep PB in the house, so i was a bit worried that the 
significant other would turn his nose at the cake…  I made this one for a
 winter-ending bbq with friends and it was a hit!! Little slices only, 
as dinner was filling, so the leftover cake was sent into the freezer 
and has since been turned into a go-to “we have to have this at all 
times” sort of snack! Your directions and pictures helped me out so

				<p>priz — You can do either. It’s a moist cake, and fairly forgiving
 of a day’s rest. That said, I prefer to bake the cakes in advance, 
stash them well-wrapped in the freezer, and frost and fill them the day I
 need them. More layer cake tips, if you’re interested, <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2009/03/layer-cake-tips-the-biggest-birthday-cake-yet/" rel="nofollow">over here</a>.</p>

				<p>I baked the cakes yesterday, stored them in the fridge overnight 
and iced it this morning for my sister-in-law’s birthday.  We all 
swooned over this cake.  I wanted to follow your recipe to a T, but the 
sour cream I thought I had on hand was a figment of my imagination.  
Using plain yogurt in it’s place worked splendidly.  The cake was 
incredibly moist and tasty, the icing and ganache, incredibly rich- 
perfect for a special occasion.  Thanks, Deb.  You never cease to amaze 
me:-).</p>

				<p>I asked my sister to make this for me for my birthday, and it was
 one of the best cakes we’ve ever had. The cake itself is just sooo 
moist and perfect, everything about it was excellent, we wouldn’t change
 a thing. I especially love the double layer of frosting, each layer 
having a unique consistency. We sat down to slices of it 4 times in less
 than 48 hours (I was visiting for the weekend). Definitely a recipe 
that will stay in our family forever! Thanks.</p>

				<p>Just made this for my boyfriend’s 30th birthday! It’s actually 
currently setting in the freezer — we ended up not having enough time 
before our dinner reservation to finish frosting it. It looks AWESOME — 
can’t wait to snack on it! However, my ganache sucks! After I added the 
peanut butter and tried to stir it over the double boiler, it just 
seized up. It’s more like dry, crumbly fudge than a sauce. Not liquid at
 all. How did I “break” it?</p>

				<p>Never mind — I added the milk (didn’t have half-and-half) and it

				<p>I made this yesterday for a friends birthday.  It was fabulous.  
Everyone LOVED it! The only problem I had was with the PB frosting.  
Once I added the PB the frosting kind of separated and I couldn’t get it
 to a smooth consistency.  It almost seemed like it had air bubbles in 
it.  I was able to wet the spatula and smooth out the frosting, but am 
wondering where I went wrong.  (The PB was Peter Pan brand).  Would love
 to make it again and have it turn out right.  Thanks and love your

				<p>I made this cake the other day for a friend, turned out great.  I
 used Maranatha peanut butter for the frosting, which is what I always 
use for recipes that call for commercial brands.  It has a much richer 
peanut-buttery taste than commercial, but the oil does separate out as 
much as brands like Adams.  It has the closest consistency to commercial
 that I’ve found, but doesn’t contain yucky things like hydrogenated 
oil.  I use it often for baking and it has never let me down…just 
thought I’d pass that along.</p>

				<p>Deb- I’ve made this cake, and it is absolutely delicious!  I need
 to make a birthday cake this weekend for a chocoholic, so  I’m thinking
 about doubling this cake recipe and making it in two 9 x 13s for a 
giant double layer sheet cake to feed a crowd.  How do you think this 
would work?  It’s a soft cake, so do you think it would be manageable?  
(Also, any estimates on baking time would be greatly appreciated!) I 
wouldn’t make the peanut butter frosting and ganache, but would use your
 raspberry filling recipe (the one on the double chocolate layer cake 
post- I think one batch should be enough?) and the ganache recipe on 
that post also (1 1/2 recipes? 2 recipes? Any ideas?).  However, how 
stable is the ganache frosting?  Can it handle being left at room 
temperature for a few hours or does it need refrigeration?  I was going 
to make and assemble this cake the day before and refrigerate it until 
the party- do you think it would keep moist and fresh overnight?  Sorry 
for bombarding you with questions, but I would really appreciate advice 
from the master baker!  Thanks!</p>

				<p>I was just reading through the comments and noticed that you 
frequently recommended both the chocolate butter wedding cake and the 
chocolate layer cake for an even more chocolatey cake than this one.  
Which one do you prefer in taste and think would be more manageable for a
 large double layered cake?  The only reason I was hesitant to use these
 two recipes was because of the coffee- does it impart a strong coffee 
flavor into the cake or does it just lend a depth of chocolate flavor?  I
 think I would need to double both to bake in two 9 x 13s- what do you 
think?  Thanks again!</p>

				<p>Oh goodness, I read through so many comments regarding the cake 
being too soft and was just about to go with the double layer recipe, 
which is my chocolate stand-by and the recipe I used for our wedding 
cupcakes. But now I’ve read comment 601 where you say that the double 
layer cake is softer. I am making a standard 3 layer cake with PB 
filling and chocolate frosting (in lieu of ganache), which recipe do you
 recommend?</p>

				<p>The double layer cake is ever-so-slightly softer. Soft cake is a 
good thing! It will be tender and moist. If it gives you any trouble 
lifting and moving, just use the freezer to firm it up while you work.</p>

				<p>I just had to come back to tell you that I went for the double 
layer cake because it is my absolute favorite. Making it reminds me of 
all the test-rounds I did for our wedding cake last year. It came out 
perfectly, I froze the four(!) layers for a bit and made the p.b. 
frosting from this recipe for the filling. Divine. Tomorrow I will add 
the ganache and present it to the lucky high school graduate. I hope she
 loves it!</p>

				<p>I made this cake in February for my boyfriends birthday, and I 
got rave reviews.  Everyone that had some told me it was the best cake 
they have ever had.<br>
Now, his sister has requested it to be her birthday cake as well.  I 
love this recipe, and I love this site!  Thank you so much! &lt;3</p>

				<p>I am now the official birthday cake hero of my family. Big hit. 
We liked it best served cold right out of the fridge the next day- I 
think I left it out too long before the initial serving so it was pretty
 soft and squishable. I agree on the serving size, we served 15 pretty 
generously and still had about a third of the cake left the next day.</p>

				<p>Okay, I think I’m going to have to sue you for… something, 
because this cake was too damn good for my hips and thighs. I used 
melted semisweet chocolate rather than cocoa and butter rather than oil,
 with some chocolate chips in the batter. I didn’t have enough of the 
same size pan, so I used a 9″ springform pan and made it a single layer,
 which took forever to bake, but it still turned out alright. I let it 
chill for about an hour before putting on the crumb coat, then let that 
chill before frosting it and pouring on the ganache. It made way too 
much cake and it’s still sitting in the house because it’s too rich to 
eat a lot at once, even though I made it on Thursday night (birthday 
cake for my Mom). My Mom put it in the freezer so that we wouldn’t eat 
it all, but that hasn’t deterred me one bit, since it seems to taste 
even better frozen. The frosting is my favourite part.</p>

				<p>I cannot thank you enough for posting this on the website.  I 
haven’t actually eaten the cake yet, but making it, from tasting the 
cake that fell off when I was putting it together, to tasting the icing 
for both the peanut butter and then the ganache!  Oh me, oh my!!!  I 
cannot wait to taste it tomorrow for my husband’s big 29th birthday!  ;)
  I feel like I should have a party now, to show off my domestic 
godessness!!!  </p>
<p>Thanks Deb!  You are a definite bookmark and a favorite.  Your tips 
made this cake so much easier to handle and it looks like your picture, 
except the top of mine is rounded out a bit… to get that “flat” look, do
 you put the top layer upside down??  and if you do is that why you use 
parchment paper in the bottom of the pans??</p>

				<p>Is it possible to cut the recipe in half? I am going to make this
 for my 3 year anniversary with my boyfriend, and since it’s just the 
two of us, we don’t need that much cake. I was going to go buy the small
 6″ round pans to make a smaller version of the cake.</p>
<p>I figured I would just halve all the ingredients, but am not sure about the adjustment in baking time.</p>

				<p>6-inch pans should halve the recipe just fine (keeping the same 
height, though). You’ll have to watch for baking time adjustment… it 
will need more than half of the baking time.</p>

				<p>Wow, wow, wow! I made this for my birthday, and it was completely
 amazing. Thank you so much for the recipe. I had two requests for the 
recipe; so there are two new smittenkitchen followers. I thought that 
the balance of the delicious, soft, but not overly sweet cake was 
perfect with the frostings. The only think I might change next time is 
to put a bit less of the chocolate glaze because it overpowered the 
peanut butter cream cheese frosting just a bit. Thanks again, Deb!</p>

				<p>I made this cake yesterday for a friends birthday, it is 
incredible!! I made the layers a week before though and froze them – the
 cake was so easy to work with this way and was still moist and 
delicious. The frosting on this cake is what makes it – it’s 
unbelievably good. Just one tip – if you use wax paper to protect your 
cake board/plate remove the wax paper after the icing and before the 
glaze. It takes away from the presentation if you lose the bottom of the
 dribbles of the glaze. This cake is even better cold the next day from 
the fridge :) Thanks for sharing it Deb!</p>

				<p>Just like all the other comments, this cake it a huge hit.  It is
 the most requested thing I have ever made.  I also have never added the
 peanut brittle to the top of the cake, just not sure I’d like that 
crunch with the super moist cake.  I have however started adding chopped
 reeses peanut butter cups to the top and it looks great sitting on top 
of the ganache.</p>

				<p>I just finished this cake for my father-in-law’s 52nd birthday 
tomorrow.  I made 3 8.5inch layers.  The cake is ridiculously moist and 
springy, the pb/cream cheese frosting almost mousse-like.  My 3.5 y/o 
and 15 m/o were fighting over who got to lick the spatula used to spread
 the glaze.  The only problem is having to wait until tomorrow to have a
 piece.  Thank you for a this recipe.  Your recipes never fail to be 
amazing!</p>

<p>I had no problem cutting the recipe in half. It translated perfectly into a 6″ cake. Baked it for about 20 minutes. </p>
<p>You were right about how rich it is. Small slices were a good idea. We got about 12-14 slices out of the 6″.</p>

				<p>I’ve made this twice and am having problems with the chocolate 
glaze. First time it was smooth but it didn’t dribble down the sides. 
The second time I used 1/2 semi-sweet and 1/2 unsweetened chocolate. It 
was thick so I thinned it with the 1/2 and 1/2. It plopped on the cake 
and smeared down the sides. UGH!!! Both times the cake was tasty. I 
guess I just have to keep on making it to get the glaze right. The PB 
frosting is, as a told a friend, inspires one to smear it on someone’s 
body and lick. It is THAT good!!!</p>

				<p>Some cruel woman posted a picture of this cake on my pregnancy 
boards last weekend.  It was pure torture for a woman 27 weeks pregnant 
to make or NOT make this cake, and so I did.  It was wonderful!  I admit
 I used tin pans because I don’t own 8 cake pans of the same size, but 
they were great because the cakes popped right out.  My husband liked it
 too &amp; did not know there was cream cheese in the peanut butter 
frosting (he hates cream cheese).  He said it looked like a bakery cake,
 which I took as a compliment because I admit I don’t usually spend much
 time on decorating.  And it passed his “oh this is going to give me a 
migraine” test for being super rich, so cutting thin slices was 
defintely the way to go.  I froze more than half because I’m afraid 
continuing to eat it will make me fail my gestational diabetes test 
Friday.  :)  This chocolate cake recipe was so moist, I may use it with 
other frostings, too – it surpasses my old stand by that’s been passed 
down in my family for generations.</p>

				<p>I should add that on the ganache, I couldn’t get the chocolate to
 smooth out on the double boiler.  So I whisked in the half and half on 
the double boiler a quarter at a time.  It worked great.  It was pretty 
thick, but I spread it over the top, allowing it to drip down the sides 
and it was perfect.</p>

				<p>This cook looks awesome!  Today is my husband’s birthday and I 
have been planning on making this for him.  Unfortunately, I lost my 
shopping list at the store last night and just barely realized I didn’t 
remember to get half and half.  Annoying.  Do you know if I can 
substitute anything for it?  I don’t bake a lot or drink coffee so I 
don’t have cream in the house.  I have milk, sour cream, butter, 
evaporated milk and sweetened condensed milk.  Do you think that I could
 monkey with any of those and be safe?  Or should I just make something 
else?  :(</p>

				<p>Thanks so much for the recipe!  I made the cake for my birthday 
and it went over like a house on fire!  For a friend’s birthday, I did 
cupcakes and filled them with the ganache using the cut out cone method 
and then frosted them with the peanut butter icing.  They were just as 
delicious but much more portable!</p>
<p>I did omit the corn syrup in the ganache for the cupcake batch so that it would be a little firmer in the center.</p>

				<p>okay, this was out of control.  it was so much fun to make!  i 
thought the peanut butter frosting was going to be a little 
too….subtle….so i melted some peanut butter in the microwave and spread 
that on each layer before frosting, sort of like the crumb coat, and in 
the end it tasted like a peanut butter kandy kake tastycake except with 
chocolate cake.  mmmmm.  i think it would also be good with yellow cake,
 believe it or not, which is more like the tastycakes of my childhood.  
only this time, with a dark chocolate bang.  thanks, deb.  you are a 
goddess.</p>

				<p>I was looking for a “last blast” before diet cake. . . so good.  
 I have a time-limiting  two year old so I used a box cake with the 1 
cup of sour cream, then pretty much followed the recipe (well. . ok. . I
 had 4 ozs of unsweet chocolate, so I bought a 4 oz bar of hersheys. . 
to finally use that up. . lol.  Worked well)    Thanks so much.  My 
neighbors thank you too, since after 2 pieces each we gave the rest 
away.  LOL.  I will say I love fudge, so this cake was best served cold 
out of fridge for me.  I had it at room temp and it was nice and light, 
but, really, I liked the cold fudge density even more.   Thanks again 
for the recipe.</p>

				<p>I did a search looking for “peanut butter chocolate cake” when my
 other half requested just that for his 30th. I came across your post 
for this recipe and I knew I just HAD to make it. While mine didn’t turn
 out as nice looking as yours, the birthday boy said that this was 
possible the best cake I had ever made (and I’ve made A LOT of cakes). 
Thanks for the inspiration! Though now I’m not sure how I’m going to top
 that next time… at least I have a year to find something equally 
amazing :)</p>

				<p>Well Deb, I am here to report that I have made this cake a total 
of four times now, for four different audiences…and it has been a 
resounding, wild, runaway success each time. I even made a gluten-free 
version for my Celiac-afflicted mum-in-law (gross gluten-free bean flour
 and oily separating organic peanut butter) and it was INDISTINGUISHABLE
 from the original…its sheer awesomeness defied the changes. I think 
this cake has made a bigger impact on my husband than anything else I’ve
 ever cooked for him, and I’m not exactly a slouch in the kitchen. He 
begs for it constantly. I think he’d trade a kidney for it.</p>

				<p>I love this cake – made it last year at Thanksgiving, and it was a
 huge hit. This past weekend, I followed the same recipe, but instead of
 peanut butter, I used nutella in the frosting (and skipped the 
ganache). It was delicious!</p>

				<p>Made this cake over the weekend for my peanut

rich, but delicious.  I made it using two 9″ rounds instead of three 8″ 
rounds.  Only needed to bake for an extra 5 minutes (40min), and it came
 out great! Keep posting the great recipes!</p>

				<p>LOVE this cake – thank you for sharing! It is so delicious, but I
 am having one problem. My peanut butter frosting never comes out 
smooth. It looks like it has tiny lumps throughout making it visually 
less appetizing though the taste and texture is still good. I’m using 
room temp ingredients and skippy peanut butter. I feel I’m following the
 directions to a tee. I just made the cake for the third time and tried 
beating in my mixer (paddle attachment) for longer than the recommended 
time, but made no difference. Any thoughts on what could fix this 
problem? And, as long as I’m asking questions, any suggestions about 
adapting the recipe for cupcakes?Thank you!!!</p>

				<p>Rebecca, did you sift the sugar and/or did you make sure the 
butter was at room temp?  Those would probably be the first culprits.</p>
<p>I just finished making this–over the course of 3 days!  We’re going 
to eat it tomorrow for my husband’s 40th birthday.  Looks great but my 
ganache was pretty thick and I couldn’t get it to drip down the sides.  I
 still think it’s going to taste amazing though, and in the end that’s 
what counts!</p>

				<p>Hi Deb!<br>
I think you answered this but I wanted a more specific response.  It is 
Wednesday and I want to make this cake for Friday.  However, with work I
 am worried I won’t have time to freeze after each step, etc.  1) Is it 
okay to make the cakes tonight, wrap and seal them dry (no icing or 
anything) and keep them in the freezer for Friday?  2) Can I ice them 
while frozen?  I hope they defrost within a few hours?? and finally 3) 
Is it okay to take it out of the fridge (for the ganache to set) while 
we got to dinner…it will be a few hours at room temperature.<br>
Thanks so much!!  Hopefully you see this before tonight.  LOVE your website:)</p>

				<p>Katie, I made the cakes on a Monday and froze them, did the first
 layer of frosting on Tuesday (frosted while they were frozen) and left 
the cake in the fridge uncovered, did the ganache on Wednesday and we 
ate the cakes on Thursday, it all worked beautifully.  There were a few 
nights where it sat out for a few hours at room temp and it was fine.  
HTH!</p>

				<p>I made this for my cousin’s birthday and it turned out horribly! 
 The frosting and glaze are wonderful, but the cake just did not turn 
out well.  It was chewy and flat.  I felt like I was chewing on 
play-doh.  Maybe it didn’t turn out because of the humidity here.  Too 
bad… I was so excited!</p>

				<p>I am making a birthday cake for a customer, and from reading some
 of the comments in this recipe, would this recipe work using your 
double chocolate layer cake recipe for the cake part, AND then using the
 pb-chocolate ganache and peanut butter cream cheese? My customer wants 
the cake to be super chocolatey, and after reading Stella’s comment and 
your reply i am thinking of using the double chocolate layer cake 
recipe, and then frosting it with the pb cream cheese frosting and the 
pb chocolate ganache from this recipe. </p>
<p>Thanks</p>

				<p>I cannot explain how amazing this cake looks and tastes! My 
daughter has chosen it for her December wedding cake, and the cake chef 
recently made us a sample cake of the recipe.  It was without doubt the 
most delightful cake any of the 30+ tasters of this sample had ever 
tasted.  I savored every morsel of my slice, and my daughter and fiance’
 drove 3 hours to get a taste. We even froze a couple slices for our son
 and his wife, and they thawed to the original taste and consistency. 
Moist does not begin to describe this cake! The icing is heavenly, and 
the ganache is beyond words.  As a matter of fact, I had never heard the
 word “ganache” before, and now I feel so cultured when I use it.  
Whether compliments go to the cake chef or recipe originator I’m not 
sure, but tasting it was a moment in time I shall never forget.  We 
expect to completely run out of cake at the wedding reception!</p>

				<p>I am “Allyson…the daughter of Jan who posted right above 
this”…and I could not let her EnThUsIaSm for this cake stand alone from 
our experience. For every chocolate and peanut butter lover out 
there…LISTEN!!!….this is A-MAZING!!! I mean I know…I promise! If I had a
 dollar for every dessert I’ve ever tried, made, or purchased because 
it’s ingredients contained chocolate and peanut butter…I would have to 
be a stinkin’ MILLIONAIRE! But in all serious…I CANNOT WAIT to have my 
non-traditional wedding cake on that oh so special day :) I’ve always 
known that my cake would HAVE TO BE chocolate cake with peanut butter 
icing, but then you couple that unforgettable creation with the 
chocolate and peanut butter ganache and WHAMMO!!! Absolute LOVE IN YOUR 
MOUTH!!! I will have to stop back by to post again once the wedding is 
over to tell of all the compliments and ooohhhsss and aaaahhhsss we got 
over the cake. It is quite true…I drove 3 hours just to taste it…and I’d
 do it ALL OVER AGAIN! HaPpY EaTiNG!!!</p>

				<p>Hi, I have never posted before, but after looking at all the 
scrumptious cakes and other confections, I stumbled upon this one and 
this looks FANTASTIC. I love all things peanut butter+ chocolate, and i 
wish i could eat a slice of this just from looking at those pictures! </p>
<p>I have a peanut butter cake recipe that I discovered in one of the 
BBC Good FOOD magazines, from British BBC Jane Hornby. Its a peanut 
butter sponge cake with peanut butter icing, caramel, and a simple 
melted chocolate top. Ive tweaked it to have homemade caramel, more 
peanut butter frosting, and chocolate ganache in the centre and on the 
top of the cake, but I never thought of making a CHOCOLATE cake!  After 
looking at yours that looks so fantastic that I think I might make one 
of these for our Slava holiday in two weeks.</p>

				<p>i made this for my own birthday a few weeks ago, and it turned 
out beautifully. i halved the recipe and made it in six inch pans; each 
layer baked for about 22 minutes. i only have 2 6 inch pans, so i kept 
the third portion in the fridge while the other two baked. i froze the 
layers as recommended, and am thankful i did as even getting them out of
 the pans and wrapped for freezing was tricky. also halved the frosting 
and ganache, and reduced the powdered sugar to about 1 1/2 cups. i saved
 about 1/4 cup of frosting to decorate with after the ganache set. it 
was a huge hit with everyone who tasted it!</p>

 that it split, and the oily part came loose from the chocolate?</p>

				<p>Deb-My daughter (7) has requested a Reese’s cake for her birthday
 this Sunday.(She’s already had lemon and strawberry cupcakes for her 
class-demanding girl) I was going to make the Devil Dog cake and find a 
peanut butter filling for it, until I found this one.This looks like the
 perfect thing…only one possible problem. We live in Florida and this 
Sunday afternoon in the park it will be about 80. I’ve made many 
successful birthday cakes over the years but the one problem I always 
have is frosting slipping and sliding off the cake when it’s warm. It 
either won’t completely set up or it thins out and slides off. Please 
help! Nobody likes a cake in a pool of frosting, no matter how tasty!</p>

				<p>Deb,<br>
Of course you have never seized chocolate before — you are just that 
good! Seized chocolate gets all grainy and lumpy and becomes a mush that
 just pushes around and around but does not melt. After more researching
 I found out that this happens if the chocolate gets too hot, or if 
water gets into the chocolate. I’m thinking my corn syrup had water in 
it possibly. or maybe next time i’ll try adding the corn syrup after 
it’s been removed from the heat. Thanks so much for taking the time to 
respond!</p>

				<p>I’m new to baking and had to look up dutch process cocoa powder

baking powder. <a href="http://whatscookingamerica.net/Q-A/CocoaTypes.htm" rel="nofollow">http://whatscookingamerica.net/Q-A/CocoaTypes.htm</a> Could you tell me why that is? I’m just curious! Thank you!</p>

				<p>It reacts <i>less</i> with baking soda, from what I understand. 
It’s an acidity issue; it is not as alkaline. Don’t worry, the cake 
works great as is!</p>

				<p>Thank you.  I make desserts for our work potlucks fairly 
regularly and have become somewhat of a celebrity there, all thanks to 
you.  I made this for our Thanksgiving meal becuase ever since I saw it 
here I had been dyin got try it.  The cake part is surprisingly easy to 
make, and after freezing was really easy to apply the frosting.  I 
didn’t even have to worry about crumbs coming off with the first 
application.  The top glaze made the cake though.  I used a dark 
chocolate 80% cacao and it was a perfect contrast for the rest of the 
sweetness in the cake and frosting.  It was rich and decadent and gone 
in less than two hours.  Thank you, and keep ‘em coming.</p>

without a doubt, the most requested thing I make!  It’s now my standard 
birthday cake!  Thanks so much!  I’m making the homemade Oreos this

				<p>this cake was amazing.  stellar compliments all around!  I used 
light sour cream in the cake and it turned out great.  also, I agree 
with Deb on this one- eat while drinking a glass of milk to wash down 
all of the chocolate-peanut butter goodness :)</p>

				<p>I’ve made this twice now since Thanksgiving and it truly is an 
amazing cake.  The 2nd time I made, I did add in a small amount of salt 
to the peanut butter frosting like some have suggested.  And I added 
probably another 2 Tbsp peanut butter to the frosting as well.  It was 
very, very good.  A definite crowd pleaser!</p>

I’ve been reading your site for years and often make recipes that you 
post. We made this cake yesterday for my little boy’s birthday party and
 I have never in my life received so many compliments on anything ever. 
That deserves a comment from a generally non-commenting fan. Thank you

				<p>I made this over the course of the last two days for a friend’s 
birthday. It may well be the most heavenly thing I have ever made. And I
 am good! It’s going to be my 2011 birthday cake, I do believe.<br>
Mine looked almost exactly like yours, only it was taller -because I 
have 8inch pans- and my ganache didn’t run down as much – because it’s 
December and there’s a frost warning.<br>
Have a happy New Year</p>

				<p>Deb, this looks AMAZING. I am making it tomorrow for my Mom’s 
60th birthday. She will be in heaven (as will the rest of us, as long as
 I do everything right.)  Instead of the peanut brittle, I think I will 
sprinkle the top of the cake with chopped salted peanuts. How gloriously
 indulgent this cake will be (my Mom’s 60th birthday is simply an excuse
 for me to splurge!)</p>
<p>Thanks for all the incredible food. I love your blog.</p>

				<p>Deb (or Kate or Robin who posted above in 657/658 about storage):<br>
Can you put the ganche on and then, let the cake sit out at room temp 
(or fridge then room temp) for a while?  I’m thinking of making, 
freezing, and frosting on a Saturday evening (storing in fridge in 
air-tight container) then, doing the ganache on Sunday right before I 
bring the cake to a brunch.  What concerns me is the cake will sit out 
at room temp for 1-2 hours before being sliced.  Will the ganche still 
be firm/hold?</p>
<p>Also, did you level their layers (i.e. cut off rounded tops)?</p>

				<p>DONT add the vinegar!!! I litterally JUST made this, let the cake
 cool some and tried a bite (without frosting) and it’s horrible. I can 
taste the vinegar in it, and it masks whatever chocolate taste you were 
supposed to like.</p>

				<p>I made the cake on saturday and after it cooled I froze the cake 
and made the frosting and put that in the fridge.  The next day took the
 cake out frozen and frosted it and had no problems frosting because the
 cake was frozen it worked great so I had no crumbs from the chocolate 
cake and lighter frosting.  I then made the glaze and that also came out
 wonderful and I was able to leave cake out so that it was defrosted for
 when I needed it.  It was a great hit we all loved it and like someone 
else said the chocolate cake it self was wonderful very moist you will 
love it. thanks again</p>

it sure adds to the pretty factor – I just sprinkled it around the

				<p>Hello! I’m new to posting here, sort of new to SK. This cake 
SCREAMED at me. I *just* finished making it for my Bro-in-law’s 
birthday; sadly I don’t get to eat it because I’m on a four-letter-word 
starting with D. But it’s mighty tempting. </p>
<p>The only issue I had with it was that the PB frosting was really 
difficult to work with. I’m a veteran of icing and decorating cakes, and
 this PB frosting was only too happy to stick to the spatula, and roll 
off the crumb coat. It was not smooth at all … I actually ended up 
*patting*  it on with a gloved hand – something I’ve never done before. 
Not with icing anyway. Maybe it was the PB I used. </p>
<p>Keep up the good work, this website is the best food porn out there 
for someone who, temporarily, can’t eat anything good. Can’t wait to 
make more of your recipes!</p>

				<p>I loved this cake.  Next time I will leave off the glaze.  i

				<p>I’m thinking of making this with the “Double Chocolate Layer 
Cake”as the base. That cake is the best chocolate cake Ive ever had, but
 is quite intense on its own. You mention that this cake is pretty 
intense. Would the very strong chocolate flavor of the layer cake recipe
 be too much with this? Or would it be cool to use that recipe instead 
of the cake recipe here?</p>

				<p>Tone – I made this awesome cake with the Epicurious 
(Double-Layer) Chocolate Cake as a base the first time and thought it 
was a bit too much richness.  Still outstandingly good taste, but just 
too intense. The Double-Layer Chocolate Cake base is IMO a far better 
chocolate cake than this one. But when you’re slathered in a peanut 
butter &amp; cream cheese frosting in addition to a chocolate &amp; 
peanut butter ganache topping, the milder chocolate cake offering from 
the recipe proper is actually a better balance choice. </p>
<p>This cake, BTW, is all sorts of greatness itself though; once-a-year (lifetime?) indulgence of calories.</p>
<p>Deb – There’s 2 small spelling errors in the Chocolate-Peanut Butter 
Glaze recipe.  It should read “semisweet” in the ingredients section and
 “In the top of _a_ double boiler” in the directions section.</p>

				<p>So bf is a chocolate and peanut lover and I’m not a fan of either
 (sad really) How should I divide the recipe so that it makes a 2 
layered 4 inch cake since I have pans for that and it seems like that 
would not be too much (since I know he’ll eat it all at once no matter 
how much I make) ? Since there are 2 eggs, should I just half it and get
 rid of the extra? (seems a waste)</p>

				<p>Made this on Monday. Delicious.. but so soft and fragile! 
Frosting/Glaze was a breeze to work with, but I have not been able to 
cut a clean slice that stands up and keeps its shape. We’re not in a 
warm weather area, so I really have no explanation for it.<br>
Other than the slices falling apart, no complaints! I’d gladly make this again and eat my smooshed up cake slices.</p>

				<p>I just made this cake for a friends birthday party. It was a HIT!
 You are totally right about needing milk to cut the sweetness. I will 
totally be making the cake again. I have always wanted a dark chocolate 
cake recipe that was easy and tasty. I just realized I have the Sky High
 cookbook! I moved recently and haven’t unpacked my cookbooks yet (the 
horror!). I will have to get it out and reread it!</p>
<p>Also how did you get the cute little drips? Mine were much bigger, tasty, but not as cute. </p>

				<p>I made this on Thursday for a meeting at work. Unbelievable! So 
delicious, and totally worth all the freezing and fussyness. It was like
 a work of art! I would recommend cutting the slices with a serrated 
knife, and having a bowl of warm water to clean the knife with in 
between slicing to cut down on the smooshing of the cake though. Yum!</p>

				<p>I am a long time reader, and have tried some of your recipes 
before. Although they resulted in tasty results, this recipe literally 
takes the cake. SO GOOD. The icing tasted awesomely of chocolate and 
peanut butter, and the cake was light enough, so everything balanced 
well—heavy icing with light cake. Everyone else called it dense and 
delicious, but I think the cake was light. It was greatness.</p>

				<p>I made this cake for my husband’s 32nd bday, and he declared it 
‘the best cake’ he’s ever had in his life! This coming from a true sweet
 tooth is high praise! It was a fair amount of work, but worth it. I 
made each of the layers in store-bought 8-inch cake tins…I froze the 
cake in the tins, and then later wrapped each layer in plastic and froze
 overnight. I had no problems handling the frozen layers to assemble the
 cake, and like Deb said, they defrosted wonderfully. The frosting 
tasted amazing…I added a bit of salt as others had done to cut the 
sweetness. I used Jif creamy pb and Philly cream cheese. I highly 
recommend this recipe, it’s delicious and impressive!</p>

				<p>Someone mentioned using bananas and I am of the same mind.  I 
think maybe either replacing the sour cream or the eggs with bananas… 
which is a better option?</p>

				<p>I made this for my roommate’s bday party and someone I had just 
met hugged me and thanked me for making it. It is sooooo rich that 
eating the third layer was purely an act of will. I am not even a fan of
 pb pie or cookies, but the frosting was perfect (although mine wasn’t 
as pretty – the glaze was everywhere). I had a little leftover batter, 
so I made cupcakes, which were much more tolerable with a single layer 
of all the good stuff.</p>
<p>One quibble: I used the hand mixer for the frosting and it and I 
struggled. My shoulder was killing me by the end. Next time, stand mixer
 all the way.</p>

				<p>Hi. I am going to make this cake in a couple weeks for a baby 
shower. Is it possible for you to explain how to get that perfect 
falling of the ganache that you have in the picture? Or do you have any 
general tips? I assume that you just put the ganache on and spread it a 
bit over the top, but yours looks so amazingly gooey.</p>
<p>Btw… I am new to your blog. I found it on flipboard for ipad and i 
cannot stop reading it. Its amazing and so inspiring. Absolutely love 
it!</p>

				<p>my apologies if this q has already been asked, but it was 
difficult to find this answer with a simple “control F” key- how long 
would you say this takes from start to finish  (active time)? it’s a 
beautiful cake and the photos are gorgeous. x shayma</p>

				<p>Maureen — At the end of step 4, I give this tip: Once the cake is
 fully frosted, it helps to chill it again and let it firm up. The 
cooler and more set the peanut butter frosting is, the better drip 
effect you’ll get from the Chocolate-Peanut Butter Glaze. You can also 
let the glaze cool down enough that it’s on the thicker, but still 
pourable, side.</p>

				<p>Wow, you weren’t kidding when you said this cake was intense. We 
had 12 people over for a surprise birthday party last night, and I 
served it to them. Like you suggested, I sliced the cake as thinly as 
possible, and there were still people who couldn’t finish their serving.
 We got through just a little over half the cake. I took the rest to 
work this morning in the hopes that I won’t have to polish off the rest 
at home. My boyfriend commented that it is almost TOO delicious, and I 
think that I have to agree.</p>

				<p>This was such a success… rich, but oh-so-good. Btw, if there are 
any vegetarians out there, I made the cake egg-less by adding two 
tablespoons of plain, whole milk yogurt instead of two eggs. The result 
is the same, super-moist cake… although I DO recommend following ALL of 
Deb’s freezer tips. </p>

				<p>I was wondering if anyone could give me any tips on decorating this? I’d like to make it as a birthday cake and write on it.</p>
<p>Ideas I am having:</p>
<p>1. Will the chocolate glaze set enough for me to write with it on top
 of the PB icing? And then maybe set up drippy ring around the edge?</p>
<p>2. What if I made it as Deb did and just wrote on it with regular 
icing? I think that would taste weird and possible look weird….</p>
<p>Help me people!</p>

				<p>Hi Deb –<br>
I was wondering if I could use this recipe (and some others) for a 
silent auction style bake sale I’m running to raise money for the 
victims of the earthquake &amp; tsunami in Japan. The baked goods from 
your blog are so fantastic – I’m hoping to feature the cocoa brownies 
and chocolate raspberry cake as well, among others. I’d also love to use
 your pictures, if at all possible. I’d of course credit your site. 
Please let me know if this is a possibility at all!<br>
Thanks!</p>

 used chunky (all I had in the house) pb and enjoyed the texture – it

				<p>Thank you!  I made this cake to celebrate my boyfriend returning 
from Afghanistan. It is gorgeous! (well, not nearly as gorgeous as 
your’s since I may have used different size cake pans for all three 
layers, but that’s besides the point) the frosting hid the different 
sizes pretty well and the ganache is BEAUTIFUL! Holy cow. Thank you so

				<p>Just made this cake for my husband’s birthday and it is, without a

The technique for making flat layers (freezing, putting in for longer 
time and lower temp) worked a charm. When you publish your book, I am 
going to order it straight away. It better be available here in the UK!</p>

				<p>I’ve had this recipe bookmarked for quite some time and finally 
talked the boy into making it for my birthday! Fabulous! The cake itself
 turned out wonderfully (very moist–yes make sure to freeze before 
frosting). We made a two-layer with 9-inch rounds without hassle (and 6 
cupcakes leftover). The cream cheese in the peanut butter frosting adds 
just a perfect amount of contrasting tang. And the chocolate ganache 
made with peanut butter? Genius! If I messed with this recipe like I was
 considering (I usually go for stronger/darker chocolate flavors 
whenever I have the chance), I would have messed it up. Very nicely 
balanced!</p>

				<p>So nobody will notice the crater in the bottom layer of the cake 
where I got a little excited, right? I’m sitting here licking the 
peanuty goodness of my beater and just had to say…this is the best cake 
I’ve ever had and I haven’t even eaten a slice yet. I’m used to altering
 recipes a little, but I’ve done this one AS IS and it’s awesome. Yes 
the cake is super soft and a little tough to move around, but I tasted a
 couple (okay…more than a couple) crumbs that fell off and it is SO 
moist and delicious. YUMMMMM!! It’s sitting in my fridge firming up 
before I ganache it.</p>

 Everyone that tried it loved it. This was my very first cake i have

pretty great. My aunt said it was the best homemade cake she has ever 
tasted, and she knows a thing or two about desserts. My mom, who is not

				<p>Like one of the people who left a comment earlier (if there is 
another recipe that has more comments than this one, please let me know 
which one it is!), when I saw this post I immediately began thinking of a
 suitable occasion to take it to. Barring that, I saw no problem in 
creating an event in order to feature this spectacular creation. Luckily
 that season of chocolate and sweet goodness was upon us and I didn’t 
have to wait for long… Deb – this is an amazing recipe, thanks so much 
for sharing it. I made it into a gluten free recipe for a gluten 
intolerant sister by substituting the plain flour with 1 1/2 cups of 
white rice flour and 1/2 cup of cornflour. One of my family commented 
that it wasn’t possible to tell that it was a gluten free cake… Everyone
 loved it, even if we did vacate the table in a sugar induced haze. (Or 
should that read ‘sugar induced high’?) I have two thirds of it left, 
and that’s after gifting some of the leftovers to family – we are only 7
 after all and, as you say, the pieces have to be very small! – so I 
plan to go gifting cake around the neighbourhood tomorrow in order to 
ensure that last portion does NOT end up in my tummy – it is precisely 
because I would like it to end up there so very much that I believe it 
is vital that I give as much of it away as I possibly can. </p>
<p>I think I have said this before, but I completely adore your site. 
I’d love to make every single thing on it. Just one teensy tiny problem –
 you have a five year headstart on me. Keep up the good work – 
fantastico!</p>

recipe with the oh-so-inspiring photos!  I decided to make it for a 
family Easter lunch but was a little nervous about ME succeeding w/ it 
(esp the ganache type glaze – never have gotten one of those right)  
Well thanks to your detailed tips &amp; instructions I DID IT!!  I must 
admit I used a box mix for the cake (sorry! :-( ) but b/c of the success
 with the rest of it (taste &amp; appearance) I am now inspired to go 
for the whole “homemade deal” next time!!  Thanks for your wonderful

				<p>Thanks for the great recipe. This is the first cake I’ve ever

				<p>Please help! I planned on making this cake in stages for a 
friend’s birthday that’s four days away. I had baked the cake layers 
today, wrapped them up and stowed away in the freezer before I realized 
that I used baking powder instead of baking soda. My cakes did not rise 
as much as yours or other readers that have made it, obviously, but they
 looked and felt fine (soft and very slightly bouncy). I don’t know what
 they taste like, however. I’m only worried that the taste and texture 
have been compromised by the mistake, so if size is not an issue, do you
 think I could possibly use these cakes and move forward with the recipe
 or do you think I should just start over (which I will do if I must but
 I’d really rather not)? I need your help! Please let me know! Thank 
you.</p>

				<p>Deb, thanks for responding so fast. Actually, my nerve got the 
better of me and so I went ahead and baked another cake. The first cake,
 when we cut into it, was very dense and soft, almost like a fluffy 
brownie and the flavor was good. While that’s not an entirely bad thing,
 I would feel much better to serve a properly made cake. Thanks again 
for your quick answer. I love your site and every recipe I’ve made from

				<p>I made this cake for my mother-in-law’s 75 birthday this weekend.
 It was AMAZING in spite of a few concerns during the making. The cake 
batter was very thin, but it turned out gloriously rich and moist. (i 
made it 2 days ahead and froze it as per your suggestion and i’m so glad
 i did) The chocolate glaze (prior to putting in the half and half) was 
very thick – like fudge – and i thought i’d done something wrong, but 
once i put the half and half in, it was perfect. One of the most 
impressive and EASIEST cakes I’ve ever made. Thanks, Deb!</p>

time (he’s a peanut butter addict). And I think it’s going to come out 
even better than before! </p>
<p>Thanks for the recipe.</p>

				<p>So my husband, much like Alex, luuuurves chocolate.  Especially 
chocolate with peanut butter.  I’ve been promising I’d make him this 
cake for his birthday since you posted it.  Today is the third birthday 
of his to pass since posting.</p>
<p>I finally made the cake.</p>
<p>I owe him SUCH an apology for not making it before this.  Oh my god, 
the cake is A-MAZING.  I even like it, and I do NOT like chocolate cake 
generally.</p>

				<p>Well, well, well………my sons birthday is tomorrow. So I asked him 
what kind of cake he wanted and surprise surprise he wants your 
chocolate peanut butter ganache cake. I am delighted that he wants me to
 make this cake for him AGAIN!!!!! It has become our family favorite. I 
first made it in December of 2008 for my two girls. They both have 
December birthdays and they requested this cake. It’s been a HUGE hit 
since then.<br>
Today will be the fifth time that I’ll make this delicious cake. And I 
couldn’t be happier. Thank you for posting this yummy yummy recipe.<br>
To the kitchen I go…………..</p>

				<p>This was magnificent.  You are correct that the cake is very 
fragile and creates a lot of crumbs–I found the amount of frosting a 
little small to crumb-coat it adequately (it was a bit tricky to frost 
as it was so delicate), but it came out looking great.</p>
<p>This cake has lasted more than 3 days in the fridge and still tastes 
and looks beautiful.  Half of the cake I froze (fully iced) on day 1 to 
bring into work, and it thawed out still looking and tasting like new.  
It’s a great keeper!</p>

				<p>Hi There. Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe. I’ve 
made this cake twice now, it tastes awesome and I’ve received rave 
reviews. I’ve also managed to get it looking very similar to yours but I
 keep having one problem with my cakes is that they turn out very dense 
like the consistency of a brownie instead of light and fluffy. Does 
anyone have any tips of what I might be doing wrong?</p>

				<p>I did read above for comments relating, but i still feel unsure about the matter,<br>
Like above, i am setting out to use this a wedding cake in July (factor in North Carolina heat)<br>
I see you recommended NOT using this chocolate cake as the base.<br>
Can you go into that a bit? Also, i am having a hard time finding the recipe you did recommend using in it’s place.<br>
Though traditionally cake sits out at the reception, I and the wedding 
party are okay with it being refrigerated until that last hour. 
Hopefully the muted (you know- doors flinging open constantly) will be 
enough, so that the frosting won’t melt.<br>
What do you think Deb?<br>
I am kinda freaking out about settling on a recipe already to start planning/testing.<br>
AND have to say, your posts are the ABSOLUTE HIGHLIGHT of my week, and i LOVE your sense of humor, much like mine-naturally.<br>
Cake timer! Gotta go.</p>

				<p>Also forgot to mention that it will be made into two half sheet 
pans. So i imagine it’s a tad less fussy and also i have been given a 
wide margin for misadventure between baking in my oven and the moment 
the cake lands on the table at the wedding.<br>
I give you these addendum so you are able to judge my situation better, 
when using this “soft” cake for a wedding-highly nontraditional as you 
know.</p>
<p>I’ll shut up now and try to stop posting</p>

				<p>If you’ll only have it out for the last hour, I think it will be 
fine. Nothing spoils that fast. There’s nothing wrong with the layer 
cake recipe, I’ve just been a bit spoiled over the years finding two I 
like even more. For a soft, tender (and probably difficult to manage in a
 large size, so less ideal for a wedding) layer, <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2007/07/you-are-owed-chocolate-cake/" rel="nofollow">use this chocolate cake recipe</a>. But for a wedding, <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2009/03/layer-cake-tips-the-biggest-birthday-cake-yet/" rel="nofollow">this chocolate butter cake</a> (which <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2008/07/project-wedding-cake-the-cake-is-baked/" rel="nofollow">I too used for a wedding</a>)
 is fantastic. It’s crumb is closer to (but softer than) a buttery pound
 cake so it’s much easier to manage if scaled to feed a crowd.</p>

				<p>Deb, I have been looking for the perfect cake to make my 
boyfriend for his 30th birthday.  He is a huge fan of anything chocolate
 peanut butter, so I am thinking about making this cake tonight, but I 
only have one round cake pan.  Do you think it would work as a bundt 
cake ?  I don’t know if I will have the time to go out and get more 
round pans, but I guess I could scale the recipe back to 1/3rd and make a
 tiny version, LOL.  I think I found a site for conversions and it said 
that one bundt pan would equal 2 8-inch round pans.</p>

				<p>You can also bake the cake 1/3 at a time in the baking pan you 
have. I haven’t tried this in a bundt but it looks like commenters #300

				<p>When my sister said she wanted a chocolate peanut butter ice 
cream cake for her birthday I immediately thought of this cake, which I 
have made several times and had excellent results every time. This time I
 put in a layer of homemade chocolate ice cream with peanut butter cups.
 Between the cake layers and ice cream I put some hot fudge and cookie 
crumbs. Otherwise everything was the same nthe results were excellent. I
 used Ben and Jerry’s ice cream cookbook for the ice cream and hot fudge
 recipes. Thanks for a great standby cake recipe that always looks and 
tastes amazing!</p>

				<p>I made this amazing cake for Fathers Day and it turned out 
perfect.  However, I did have trouble with the final chocolate glaze.  I
 tried to use Nestle Semi-Sweet chips instead of baking chocolate and 
failed (twice) misserably.  Thanks to a call to my mom and my third trip
 to the store I bought new chocolate and it worked like a charm.  You 
might want to make a note in the ingrediant list (sorry if I missed it) 
to make sure to use semi-sweet baking chocolate for perfect glaze.  
Great recipe and I love your site!!</p>

				<p>I came here to write down ingredients on my list for my husband’s
 birthday coming up and I realized I didn’t chime in last year when I 
first made this.  No shame in being comment #791, right?</p>
<p>I made this exactly as written.  It was incredible.  Just perfect for
 my husband.  I wouldn’t change a thing.  My mom came to visit shortly 
after my husband’s birthday and even just looking at the leftovers she 
said, “That is the most beautiful cake I’ve ever seen.”</p>
<p>It’s a GREAT cake for a special occasion!</p>

				<p>I’ve made this cake a bunch of times now. It is a HUGE hit. 
EVERYTIME. EVERYWHERE. I’ve had people pay me to make this cake for 
them.  I actually break down the cake into steps.  I make the cake, wrap
 it really well in plastic wrap and freeze them until I need to assemble
 it. (Usually at least  a day, sometimes a week.)  Follow Deb’s steps on
 chilling she is absolutely right!<br>
Deb, great blog, on of the few I read.  Thank you! for being here!</p>

				<p>This is Mary of the hot North Carolina wedding. Cake was 
absolutely perfect. I took it out an hour before as you suggested, and 
it lured everyone to the cake table, not just the kids. No melting of 
any sort. Your advice on freezing cake/chilling cake- all perfect and i 
love you.<br>
I wanted to thank you for writing me back. It totally calmed my nerves 
about the cake (think i just needed to actually bake and stop thinking 
about it) and it’s so cool to know that you’re actually listening and 
YOU CARE!<br>
The best part i discovered was that mixing the batter by hand made the 
cake twice as lofty, than when i used my Kitchen Aid. Go figure. But i 
love mixing by hand, makes me feel closer to the process.<br>
And also, my cake was so soft when i was about to wrap it in plastic to 
freeze. I was concerned it would come apart when unwrapping and stick to
 the plastic, so i dusted the sheet cakes with instant espresso powder.<br>
That was a clever and tasty addition that i might just keep.<br>
Also used your “Best Yellow Cake” for wedding sheet cakes #2 and #3 for “Strawberry Shortcake” – also perfect.<br>
That is now my go to yellow cake most definitely.<br>
So, obviously, what I’m sayin here is YOU ROCK the cake world.<br>

				<p>Quick question… when I make a regular ganache, I have to let it 
sit for a few hours before it reaches that “still runny but not too 
runny as to run all over the cake but rather just make nice interesting 
drip patterns like yours” stage. Since this glaze says to use it while 
warm, how long did you let it sit before pouring it over the cake? I 
love that you can still see the peanut butter cream cheese beneath it! 
Thanks!</p>

				<p>comment #onebazillion:<br>
i’ve made this cake several times, which means it’s freaking fantastic 
because i rarely repeat recipes. just a tip for anyone who hates getting
 peanut butter out of measuring cups as much as i do: i always line my 
measuring cup with a big piece of plastic wrap and measure the peanut 
butter directly onto the wrap. once you get it all packed in there, just
 pick up the plastic wrap and dump the pb straight into the bowl. it 
comes off the plastic with ease in one big clump, and you’re left with a
 clean measuring cup so you don’t have to spend forever scraping peanut 
butter out of every little nook and cranny. hope someone else finds this
 little tid bit as useful as i do! :)</p>

				<p>Charlotte — I mentioned this in a few earlier comments, but there
 are now 800 comments and I wouldn’t expect you to have read them all! I
 chilled the cake. A combination between a cooled down cake and cooling 
the ganache enough that it starts to thicken ever-so-much make the 
ganache run slowly. You can always test it with a small amount. Also, if
 it puddles on top of the cake and doesn’t want to run down, you can use
 a spatula to nudge it over the sides in specific spots.</p>

				<p>I made it today, only 3 years after you posted, for my very own 
chocolate addict’s birthday. deb, you are a cake goddess! I read all the
 comments and your replies before i tried my hand at it, and it came 
together so easily with all this information! this was the fifth of your
 cake recipes I tried, and by now I just tell my man: “this is one of 
deb’s” and he goes “oooh, she who brought us brownie-mosaik-cheesecake? I
 like Deb.”</p>

				<p>I made this for a coworkers birthday and it was FANTASTIC.  
Everyone raved and people who weren’t even at work heard about it and 
came in for some!  I actually split the batter into 2 9-inch pans 
because that’s what I had and just did the 2 layers.  I would’ve liked 
it more with the 3 I think!  It was simply amazing and I can’t make it 
again!</p>

				<p>Made this cake today and it was delicious. Just made the cake and
 frosting without the glaze, but we were still blown away! The delicate 
texture of the cake is only matched by its moist and delicious flavor. 
Freezing is a must for handling and frosting, but the extra time is well
 worth it. The cake alone is possibly the best I have ever tasted. 
Thanks again for another wonderful and practically infallible recipe :)</p>

				<p>Wow!  I made this cake with only one change and it was AMAZING!  I
 only had 2 cake pans so I just made a double layer.  It was rich so I 
think 2 layers was plenty. Very moist cake and what a wonderful peanut 
butter frosting!  Everyone loved it!  I will definately make this cake 
again!!!!  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!  And, thank you for the 
tip of putting the cakes in the freezer and then the fridge when 
frosting.  It DID help tremendously!</p>

				<p>Just made this and it was pretty good. I ordinarily absolutely 
detest desserts with peanut butter in them, but I made this for my 
roommate’s birthday and it was a huge hit. Nice and moist, good crumb, 
didn’t stick to the pans. I didn’t have sour cream or buttermilk so I 
dumped some apple cider vinegar in 3/4c of skim milk and then added 
about 1/4c of mayonnaise and that worked great, although I had to reduce
 the water in the cake by about 1/2c-5/8c. I also didn’t have parchment 
so I cut tinfoil rounds and that worked just fine. Oh, I also used 9inch
 rounds and two layers, and 14oz cream cheese and 3/4c peanut butter 
because I have a heavy hand with frosting, and also only a fork (no 
whisk or electric mixer) and a wooden spoon so I knew it wouldn’t gain 
any volume from beating air into it. So, just so you know, this cake 
works great in really ghetto situations. I decorated the top with plain 
cocoa powder since I didn’t have ingredients for ganache. When I started
 writing this, I was going to ask permission to post this recipe on my 
own cake blog, but I guess I made a different cake in the end. But 
still, may I post my adapted recipe? (I love your blog, btw. Also made 
the cocoa powder brownies and it is now my favorite brownie recipe 
ever.)</p>

				<p>So I stumbled across your site last night and fell in love! I 
made this cake today and was planning on taking it into work 
tomorrow…unfortunately, I didn’t follow your cooling instructions 
exactly and the cake cracked….thenI decided to make it into trifle for 
work…but ate a little piece and decided it was too good to share with 
the co-workers!! :) can’t wait to try this again and look forward to 
trying many more of your recipes!!</p>

				<p>I made this for my husband’s birthday last night and if he ever 
leaves me, I know where he’ll be headed!  He forbade me from putting it 
away until midnight.  “It’s still my birthday and I want to admire my 
cake.”<br>
It also has many steps that lend themselves well to participation from a
 three year old-which was crucial as my daughter is a devoted kitchen 
helper.<br>
I’ve enjoyed checking in with you for quite a while for tasty pastry 
recipes (your homemade oreos and scones-both dreamy cream and raspberry 
ricotta are household staples) and I’ve also recently discovered I 
equally love your savory recipes.  The charred corn tacos were a hit and
 the spaghetti with Swiss chard and garlic chips helped us use some of 
the harvest from our garden in the tastiest way yet.<br>
Thanks for doing what you do, and please keep it up!</p>

				<p>I had such high hopes for this cake. After all the reviews were 
endless, but often hard to navigate through. We get it the cake looks 
good. Anyhow I made this cake and all I taste is the vegatable oil. I 
even used a mild flavored one but it is very overwhelming giving no 
other flavor to the cake. I’m hoping it gets better with age.</p>

				<p>Thank you for posting this cake recipe.  My husband loves 
chocolate and peanut butter, so I finally got around to making this and 
served it last night.  We loved it!  I made it exactly as is, except 
heated the ganache in the microwave (in two 30 second bursts before 
adding the half and half) and added a pinch of salt to it.  I’m so 
impressed with everything you do.  You are my inspiration to keep 
cooking and baking even with my 10-month old under foot!  Which reminds 
me – my little one loves your spinach and sweet potato recipe.</p>

				<p>Just made this cake for my husband’s birthday and we have not 
stopped uttering awe-stricken obscenities since we tasted it. Only hit 
one snag – when I added the half and half to the glaze, it turned into 
something that looked like mousse and I had to add more corn syrup to 
get it back to a pourable consistency. I gotta say the peanut butter 
cream cheese frosting really makes it though, it is frighteningly good.</p>

so long?), and suddenly I was famous for my baking skills!</p>
<p>Before making the cake, I read through all the comments. I added a 
little bit of strong coffee, and only made two layers, and the cake 
turned out perfect. I’ll be baking it again this weekend, and I’m 
already terrified of the effect the dangerous frosting will have on my 
waistline ;)</p>

				<p>OK.. ok… Back to my comment above….<br>
My first two layers were thin ( only 2 cake pans, so divided the batter 
the best I could) but the third had more batter and was a nice thick 
size. I put the smaller layers on bottom and on top wit the thicker 
piece in the middle. I followed the notes and used the freezer to freeze
 the cakes a couple of times before frosting and before the final layer 
of frosting and also after I did the drizzle.. Wow!!!!!!! Talk about 
Delicious and Beautiful!!!!!… I am soooo making this cake again 
soon!!!!!!<br>
Thank You!</p>

				<p>I made this cake for a peanut butter lover’s housewarming, and 
his complaint was that it was “too chocolate-y.”  Next time, I think 
I’ll forego the ganache.  The combination of chocolate ganache and very 
rich chocolate cake was a bit of an overload.  An Ohioan, I usually 
modify my buckeye candy filling and use that as peanut butter frosting, 
so trying this version (with cream cheese!) was very interesting.  This 
peanut butter frosting held up well in transport (and during fridge 
time), but I think I prefer the taste of a butter-rich and cream cheese 
free version.</p>

				<p>I just finished frosting it for my own 24th tomorrow :) I won’t 
ganache it till later. It was all I could do not to shovel that frosting
 into my mouth, but I’m a little nervous about the cake. The batter 
tasted wonderful, but after I baked it, the cakes smelled like 
strong-new-Rubbermaid-smell. They were new cake pans, but clearly I had 
washed them before I used them. Here’s hoping! But it will probably be 
ah-mazing. I will try to remember and report back.</p>

				<p>Deb I finally made this cake for my husband after having only 
told him about it three years ago just when we started dating (I made it
 for a party the week before our first date and it just didn’t make 
it!). Of course he loved it, but the funny thing is about a week after I
 made it, I was talking about what I might make for dinner and he looks 
at me and says, “You know what you should make? That amazing cake of 
deliciousness!” (That’s more or less how we talk around here.) </p>
<p>On a different note, I tried a real crumb coat for the first time, 
and the cake was so soft around the edges (I don’t think I greased the 
sides of the pan very well) that frosting it quickly tore up the edges 
and I had so many crumbs in the coat that some made it into the outer 
layer. If you happen to have tips on crumb-coating, or perhaps getting 
the sides of my cake more firm (the layers had been in the freezer at 
least half an hour), I will take them. I really think it turned out 
well, in spite of a few crumbs, but I feel like I was unnecessarily 
frustrated by a crumb coat and I would almost rather have taken more 
time and just frosted the darn thing instead.</p>

				<p>Hi Diane — Glad the cake lived up to expectations! The cake is 
crazy soft, as you noticed; I find that sticking the layers in the 
freezer to firm them up (you don’t need to freeze them fully, just 
enough that their edges feel firm) helps get the crumb coat on without 
messing up the sides. Hope that helps next time. There will be a next 
time, right?</p>

				<p>What an amazing cake! I made it for my boyfriend’s birthday in 
July and he keeps asking me to re-make it :) It didn’t turn out as 
pretty as yours, but the taste was divine. I’ll have to make it again. I
 never used to be a peanut butter fan, but this actually inspired me to 
do a whole post on peanut butter in the US on my blog. Go figure! Thanks
 for the recipe!!</p>

				<p>I just have to tell you that I found this recipe in 2009. I was 
looking for a cake to make for my boyfriend (now husband- probably 
because of this cake lol) for his birthday. He loves chocolate and 
peanut butter so I thought this sounded great. We loved it then- and 
still love it now. It has become a yearly tradition now to make this 
cake on his birthday- I asked him this year if he ever wanted another 
cake for his birthday and he said “ABSOLUTELY NOT”. Everyone loves it- 
and they talk about it all year long. They can’t ever wait for his 
birthday to come around- just to eat the cake. Thank you for posting it!</p>

feeling lazy but am responsible for cake for a friend’s party this 
weekend. think i made this last year with the fudge frosting for my 
daughter’s 2nd birthday,  but am really too sleep deprived to remember.

				<p>sory – meant to ask if you thought would be good  combo?  or 
better question yet, how does this cake complare to the chocolate butter
 cake and double chocolate layer cake?  i know i made one of the 3 and 
it was out of this world, but am now doubtful that i made a cake with 
coffee in it for my 2 year old daughter.  though you really never know. 
thanks – and sorry first question not the right question!</p>

				<p>The chocolate butter cake is sturdier, closer to but really not a
 pound cake. It’s very moist and stacks well. The double chocolate layer
 cake is as soft as this one but I think it has better chocolate flavor.</p>

				<p>Wow – over 800 comments and counting. Is that a new record?? I 
just made this into cupcakes for my husband’s bday. I got 30 cupcakes 
and cooked them at 335 for 22 minutes. They came out nice and soft. 
Because he requested a cupcake that was both frosted and filled (and I 
love him dearly so I was happy to oblige!) I used the choco-pb ganache 
to fill them – by just piping it into the center. Since they are a 
fairly soft cake it was easy to pipe into the center. I used the pb 
frosting as is and since I had a little of the ganache left, I spooned a
 bit on top of the frosting. They were a huge hit with my husband! We 
are having a little party tomorrow, and I’m sure they will be a big hit.
 I haven’t eaten one yet and so I’m curious to see how they compare to 
your double chocolate layer cake, which I have also made into cupcakes 
twice. </p>
<p>Since I had some buttermilk in the fridge, I used a little to replace
 some of the water. Most of my favorite cake recipes include it, and it 
seems to have worked well. The batter was certainly delicious.</p>

				<p>Wow, this looks like the recipe that will get you over the 1000 
comment mark. It’s no wonder! It’s an amazing cake. I’ve brought in 
quite a few baked goods for my coworkers (at least a dozen cakes), and 
everyone agreed that this was there favorite. </p>
<p>I made this in the middle of the night before I started the graveyard
 shift. I find a complicated baking project keeps me up, no problem. 
This is the first time I successfully used the crumb coating technique. 
My coworkers said my cake looked just like the pictures when I showed 
them your website which I consider the biggest compliment of all.</p>
<p>Thanks for another amazing recipe.</p>

				<p>Like Trina, I too found it easier to pat the delicious delicious 
frosting on by hand. It was kind of clumpy to spread, so I just started 
patting it on and it worked great! Applied it and smoothed with my 
fingers.</p>

				<p>Hi there-<br>
  I didn’t see it asked about on a quick glance through all the 
comments…but why the parchment paper lining the pans? Can I do without 
that? Sorry if it’s been addressed already. This looks incredible and my

				<p>Rochelle — It’s a very soft cake and the parchment paper will 
guarantee that you get it out easily. You can butter and flour the pans 
well and you should probably be fine, but only parchment can guarantee 
easy release. Good luck!</p>

				<p>I just made this and oh my god. I kept scraping at the bottom of 
the pan and was hoping that there would be enough cake left by the end 
of it.</p>
<p>I actually made it into a birthday cake and did a cream cheese 
chocolate icing on it, I think it’s one of the best chocolate birthday 
cakes I have made.</p>

				<p>I actually used two round pans with the sliding handle and the 
cake came out perfect, I had previously greased the pan as well. The 
cake is very moist so I would be careful but it has quite some weight to
 it so it comes out fast. I definitely put some parchment paper at the 
bottom of it because it will stick to surfaces.</p>

				<p>Made this cake yesterday and have left it overnight for today’s 
birthday party. I am quite sure that it will be heavenly good. I have 
not tried the cake yet, but I ate quite some of the filling which was 
amazing.   </p>
<p>I actually made it into four layer square cake, since I only had one 
round pan and felt too lazy for baking three times. I used that deep 
standard pan that comes with the oven and have cut the cake into four 
parts afterwards. </p>
<p>For those that had problems spreading the frosting I would recommend 
omitting some confectioners sugar. I think I used only three cups of it 
and the frosting was maybe already too runny but I wanted it to be less 
sweet in any case. </p>
<p>thank you once again for this wonderful site and this amazing cake!</p>

				<p>I know that almost 1000 people have commented on this page, and 
that the post is not new.  I feel like adding my 2 cents now is a little
 silly; everyone has moved on.  But I just finished ganaching (heh) this
 cake and it is absolutely gorgeous!  I was leery of the ganache step.  
My last attempt to use it and make chocolatey drips along the sides of a
 cake did not go very well.  The ganache was too cool and too thick and 
just sort of piled on top of the cake in very unappealing clumps.  I 
ended up just icing the cake with it. As it was a bundt cake, it wasn’t 
very pretty.  Tasty, but ugly.</p>
<p>This though!  This!  Your tips on cooling the frosted cake were 
dead-on and the ganache behaved exactly like it was supposed too.  This 
is the prettiest cake I have ever made and I can’t wait to serve it 
tomorrow.</p>
<p>So, though it may be spitting in the ocean at this point (854!), 
Thank you!  I don’t know how I cooked/baked anything before finding this
 site!</p>

				<p>Quick question for you, Deb.  You suggest a “crumb coat” of 
frosting….does that mean you use a thin layer of the peanut butter 
frosting, let it set in the fridge and then put another layer of the 
peanut butter frosting on top of that?    800+ comments. wow!  Is that a
 record?  Planning to make this cake for Thanksgiving…if I can wait 
until then.  thank you for sharing!</p>

				<p>Hi</p>
<p>This cake looks amazing!!<br>
I just wanted to check though, the peanut butter frosting, 5 cups of 
sugar? is that right? I’m working in ounces, and the most ounces of 
sugar i’ve ever used in anything is about ten. five cups is forty 
ounces, so i’m thinking this must be too much!!</p>

layers and refrigerate after frosting/ before ganache so it turns out as

				<p>@Ellie- Confectioner’s sugar always shrinks down the moment it’s added to liquid, so it’s not as much as it seems.  :)</p>

				<p>I made this cake as a three tiered wedding cake 2 years ago for 
100 people and it was delicious. I came back for the recipe for our 
anniversary today. Peanut butter and chocolate make a true marriage. 
Haha. But I used the ganache as a second coating rather than using a 
drizzle effect and topped it with fresh red roses. Highly recommended.</p>

				<p>Thank you so much for this awesome recipe! I made it as a 9″ two 
layer cake for my son’s birthday last night and it was a HIT! My 
mother-in-law was speechless! :-) Thanks again! </p>
<p>PS- I served 5 adults and 6 children and still have half the cake left! Rich, rich, rich deliciousness!</p>

				<p>I used the glaze on another cake and although I let my cake chill
 for 2 hours it still didn’t turn out the way the photo looked. I was 
disappointed. My frosting was also cheese cake based. I guess the lesson
 here is the glaze cannot be used with just any cake but this one?!</p>

				<p>How did it look different? It should work on most cakes. The 
trick to getting the thick, dramatic drips is to have the topping cooled
 too the point where it’s just barely pourable, i.e. quite thick and to 
pour it over a cold, cold cake, so it drags a little running down the 
sides.</p>

				<p>Just be careful to use real semi-sweet chocolate.  First time I 
tried to use Nestle chocolate chips for the glaze and when combined with
 the corn syrup, it seized on me…</p>

				<p>I’m glad I stumbled across this! My boyfriend requested pb cake 
for his bday on Friday. I will definitely be making this! I know you 
used 3 9″ pans for your cake, but I’m going to try 2 9″ pans. According 
to the cake pan conversion chart, the volume of 3 8″ pans should equal 2
 9″? (not that I mind having shorter cakes, I’m just too lazy to make 3 
:) Hopefully it will work out! Yum! Last year I baked him your red 
velvet cake, to die for.</p>

				<p>I made this cake for my husband’s birthday yesterday. I used one 
13X9 pan (this recipe makes a ton of cake). My ingredient modifications 
included: light sour cream in the cake, one less cup of powdered sugar 
in the frosting, and I also added sea salt to the peanut butter 
frosting. It was a HIT!!! The cake was good. Thanks for sharing this 
recipe.</p>

				<p>made this last week for my husband who is a reeses fan, with no 
modifications.  it was a very moist and dense (but not too dense) cake. 
 the double frosting layers were perfect too.  i have many chocolate 
cakes from scratch and this is now one of my 2 favorite recipes.  it was
 an awesomely delicious cake.</p>

				<p>Hi Deb, I adapted this to gluten-free. The recipe is on my 
website. It works really well with simply subbing gluten-free 
equivalents. No need to buy expensive thickeners etc. That’s just one of
 the reasons why I love moist, dense cakes – they’re easy to make 
gluten-free. </p>
<p>I served it to my extended family and friends on Christmas, then 
brought the leftovers to work and not one of them suspected that it was 
gluten-free.</p>
<p>Thanks for another winner!</p>

				<p>I made this cake for my husband (who loves all things that 
combine peanut butter and chocolate) on his birthday a couple of years 
ago, and he LOVED it!  It was very rich, so we cut it into very small 
slices, and it took us about a week to finish it!  Since then, he 
started eating a vegan diet whenever possible, so for his birthday 
tomorrow, I am borrowing the peanut butter frosting recipe to use on  
some cupcakes for him.  I will be using vegan cream cheese and 
margarine.  Hope it turns out!</p>

				<p>I made this cake for a New Year’s Eve party and it went over 
extremely well. The other guests LOVED it, but I would make a few 
suggestions. First, I have a better chocolate cake recipe. The cake was 
good, but there was that constant nagging thought that it could be 
better! The peanut butter frosting was down right fantastic. As for the 
chocolate peanut butter drizzle, I would add vanilla and perhaps a 
little bit more peanut butter. It was a little too bitter for my liking.</p>

				<p>I’ve made this cake twice now.  Once for my husband’s birthday, 
which deemed me “Lord of the Cake!” by the second person I made it for, 
which was my husband’s best friend.  Both times the cake received rave 
reviews &amp; a few “best cake ever” responses.  The cake is SOOOO moist
 &amp; rich, the icing is the perfect peanut buttery sweetness &amp; the
 ganache just adds that final touch of decadent perfection.  I would 
have to agree that this just might be the best cake ever.</p>

				<p>I made this cake today for a ladies party.  Huge hit – I left off
 the ganache due to time and it was still wonderful just with the peanut
 butter frosting.  The cake is so moist – the sour cream really makes 
this cake.  Everyone loved it.  I cut the butter in half for the 
frosting and added more peanut butter.</p>

				<p>Hi Deb,</p>
<p>I love your blog – I really think it is one of the best on the web.  I
 was looking for a chocolate peanut butter cake and I found this one.  
With 900 comments (as far as I can tell, all positive) I knew this was 
going to be the one.  I made it yesterday to serve today for a surprise 
for my boss’ birthday and everyone went crazy for it.  I have sent a 
number of people your URL.  </p>
<p>Small changes I made were to add 2 Tbsp espresso to the cake batter, 
use only 4 cups of icing sugar in the frosting, and because I know my 
boss well, instead of the PB-chocolate ganache, I made a dark chocolate 
ganache.</p>
<p>Thanks for making me look so good!  </p>
<p>Susan</p>

				<p>I know this is an old post but I’m trying a comment/question 
anyway! I want to make this for my husband’s birthday. How far in 
advance can I make the cake layers? And if I do it in advance, should I 
put them in the freezer or fridge? I have a tiny, NYC size freezer so I 
am not sure I’ll have room for them, even if just for 30  minutes to do 
the firm-up. Can I firm them up in the fridge if I decide to do it all 
at once? Thanks!!! The cake looks amazing!</p>

				<p>Hi KJ — I’ve got a ton of <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2009/03/layer-cake-tips-the-biggest-birthday-cake-yet/" rel="nofollow">layer cake tips here</a> that I hope will help. Briefly, I’ve got a small freezer and they did fit. I would freeze the layers <i>or</i>
 keep them at room temperature but not make them more than a day or two 
in advance. In both cases, wrap them well. I use an offset spatula to 
ice cakes. Getting the peanut butter frosting very cold, and the 
chocolate-peanut butter draping fairly thick will get you those nice 
thick drips you see in my photos. Good luck!</p>

 could it just be it wasn’t cool enough? Any thoughts would be great.

				<p>Everyone listen! My brother and I made this cake one day for fun,
 and served it to the family. My bro and I never bake, but THIS. CAKE. 
BLEW. MINDS. Of all the baking my family has ever done, this cake is 
everyone’s favorite, and they force us to make it regularly. It is not 
too expensive to make, and it is rich, moist, and wonderful. We use it 
for birthdays, parties, and I even made one for my boss’s Super Bowl 
get-together, and it was a hit! This is one of the greatest recipes to 
ever be available through a Google search. My brother and I are 
constantly editing the recipe in little ways, but it’s hard to perfect 
something that is practically perfect already! But I recommend trying 
coconut oil, and maybe some coconut shavings in the batter. Adds to the 
texture and taste! Make this cake!!!</p>

				<p>Just wanted to check and let you know I made the cake and it was 
seriously amazing. So delicious–everyone loved it. The only thing is it 
was pretty ugly–my layers were uneven and the glaze was a little too 
thick so  I didn’t get those pretty drips, just globs. Next time I’ll 
work on how it looks, but taste-wise, it was great. thanks!!</p>

				<p>Made this for a birthday – it is RICH and SERIOUSLY DELICIOUS.  
Like, I’m not sure there could be a better PB &amp; Chocolate iteration 
of cake in existence, this was that spot-on.  That said, I used a Lot 
more peanut butter than called for in the recipe – I thought the taste 
was hardly there and moreso just sweet otherwise – but like a cream 
cheese frosting, you can do this ad hoc and keep adjusting to your taste
 as you mix.   I forget, but I might’ve adjusted the glaze for thickness
 too – also somewhat easy to eyeball, and I don’t think you can go too 
wrong (that adjustment, if any, was minor).  Enjoy.   Completely worth 
it – don’t be offended if it’s not finished right away b/c it is Very 
Rich, but in a divine sort of way that just takes time to consume – the 
guest home finished all of it over time on their own :)   Thanks SK this
 was a home run.</p>

				<p>Oh, and the extra PB did make my frosting less even and probably 
far more difficult to spread, but looks-wise, you could hardly notice 
anything was off underneath the ganache, you can bring it to a home-made
 spatula-spreading look and cover the rest.</p>

				<p>Ugh last post I promise – I’m nearly drooling just thinking about
 it again – but I wanted to add that the cake was perhaps the moistest 
thing I’ve had.  I’ve been trying to bake often for the last year 
(thanks SK) and this has to be the best thing I’ve baked and you know 
when you make it that it will forever be an all-star.   Ok, I’m done.  
But if there’s someone in the bakers’ world who still hasn’t made this, 
MAKE IT MAKE IT MAKE IT MAKE IT MAKE IT.   You know that Aziz Ansari 
skit where he makes fun of the Coldstone Creamery sizes being for drug 
addicts — “Gotta have it!!” — it’s that kind of  good.</p>

				<p>Just made this for the fam! It was delicious as all recipes on this blog are.<br>
I accidentally added an extra cup of sour cream and it was so moist! Almost fudgy. Didn’t taste like a mistake.<br>
I also omitted the ganache because I was afraid of going into diabetic shock!<br>
The frosting was verrrry sweet, almost too sweet. and I loooove sweets. I
 wonder if you could leave out a cup of sugar and the consistency would 
still be ok.<br>
There was almost not enough frosting to coat all three layers.</p>

				<p>Deb! Can you help?</p>
<p>I made this cake for my husband back when you first posted it and it 
was pretty much the best cake ever. Since then, I’ve gone on a pretty 
strict paleo diet (so no cakes!). I’m going to make this one again for 
his birthday this year, though! Because it’s the best cake ever.</p>
<p>Since I’m a crazy person, I’m having issues with the cup of vegetable
 oil. Is there another oil I can substitute that isn’t canola or 
soybean? I’m not so good with the baking. Would a more saturated fat 
like coconut oil mess it up?</p>

				<p>Hi Deb, I am making this cake for the first time for my father’s 
b’day. My parents are coming to stay this weekend and thought this would
 be a wonderful surprise, and beautiful center piece for my table! I am 
making the cake layers tonight and freezing them as you have suggested. I
 was wondering if I could do the same with the PB frosting? If not can 
you suggest a way to prepare the frosting ahead of time and how to keep?
 </p>
<p>P.S. Love, Love, Love this blog. Plan to make this a Julie &amp; Julia experience. =)</p>

				<p>Would you believe that I’ve never tried to freeze frosting 
before? Theoretically, it should work but I cannot give you my word. But
 it’s all butter and sugar… can’t imagine how it would flop.</p>

				<p>Thanks Deb…I have frozen plain cream cheese frosting before (just
 butter, sugar, CC + vanilla). I let the frosting come to room temp 
before using and worked like a charm. Just didn’t know if the actual PB 
would make a difference or not. I am going to go for it and will let you
 know how it turns out after the weekend. Thanks for the quick response!</p>

				<p>Hi Deb :)</p>
<p>I love this cake!  I make it all the time with chocolate frosting (my
 husband is the peanut butter fanatic – not me, lol).  It’s always a 
hit.  However, as you mentioned, it is a bit soft and once or twice has 
broken in half from the weight when I have frosted it.  However, my 
biggest problem is that I have tried to increase the recipe by 1/3 (it 
gets eaten up too fast by my enormous family) and when I do that, the 
cooking time is crazy long and it seems to fall in the oven even if I 
haven’t sneaked any peeks.  Do you know what I could do to counteract 
the falling problem?  More baking soda?  Less?  </p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>P.S.  Saw your recommendations for the wedding cake if you’re just 
making this with chocolate frosting.  Will try that next time. :)  
Thanks for sharing your recipes!</p>

				<p>I made this cake the other day for my best friends birthday! I 
did not sprinkle the top with peanut brittle but made a peanut butter 
meringue that I cracked and sprinkled on top and added to the filling. 
The frosting on this was amazing and lovely and yes I totally dipped 
sliced apples into the small bit I had leftover.</p>

				<p>Hi Deb…just an update on freezing the frosting…it worked 
beautifully. It came out a little thicker than your normal cream cheese 
frosting but in working with a frozen cake it spread like butter. The 
cake was devoured in 3 days! (only 4 of us working on it thought it was 
pretty amazing) My dad loved it and I think my husband fell more in love
 with  me for making it. =) Thanks again for an amazing recipe.</p>

				<p>I made this last night (cheated with a Devil’s Food cake mix for the actual cake) for a co-worker’s birthday. It was so HEAVY! </p>
<p>In fact, the icing created a crevice/landslide of cake but after 
freezing to firm it up and the glaze, couldn’t see it! I wouldn’t 
recommend using a light cake like Devil’s Food with this because it 
seems to weigh it down too much. The final cake was probably the 
heaviest two layer cake I’ve ever held.</p>
<p>However, it tasted amazing and you weren’t kidding about needing milk!</p>

<p>I’m making this cake at the moment for a friend’s birthday and it’s 
taken me just under an hour from start to finish to cook the sponges.</p>
<p>The frosting and the glaze will take another half an hour in total 
and with the cooling time for the sponges it’ll take about 2 hours from 
start to finish including icing time. </p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

				<p>This is the cake that my mom and I made for my wedding….everyone RAVED about it and are begging us to make them cakes now.<br>
We actually made it a week in advance of the wedding and the people that
 snuck several slices from the reception told us that it was still 
amazing a week after the wedding! It has an incredible life span and 
never got dry.<br>
Its been in the freezer for several months now and I’m excited to see if
 it’s still good on our one year anniversary….I’m positive that it will 
still be just as good. (Yes, we saved the top layer of this cake instead
 of my cake because it was incredible!)</p>

				<p>BEST cake ever ..<br>
This is the first time I write comments on cakes as this was just the 
best cake ever. My husband loves peanut butte, I made this cake for his 
birthday last week. It was easy, and the directions were just right.<br>
It was YUMMY and it looks amazing. The idea of baking 3 separate cakes made it looks very professional<br>
He said it was the best cake I ever made, and I bake a lot.<br>
I have 2 requests already to bake this cake for friends birthday.<br>
NET NET … THE BEST Cake.<br>
I am running to buy the book !</p>

				<p>I have now made this twice.  The first time i rushed it a little,
 and it was amazingly delicious but looked a mess.  Today, an attorney I
 work for asked if I could bake a cake for his son’s birthday and 
mentioned peanut butter and chocolate…I was very nervous making this 
again for someone else, but I followed the instructions meticulously, 
and even chilled things LONGER than you recommended, and it is 
beautiful! It looks a lot like yours!!  I did chop up some peanut butter
 cups as a garnish, as a few have suggested, and it looks so yummy.  Now
 I am reluctant to take this to work tomorrow…Do you think my boss will 
notice if there is a slice cut out??! ;)<br>
Thanks for such a great site and such a WONDERFUL recipe!</p>

				<p>I made this cake today for my husband’s bday. It was absolutely 
delicious. I used 3-9″ inch cake pans and it worked fine. In lieu of the
 peanut brittle I used chopped up Reese’s peanut butter cups and 
sprinkled them over the top of the cake. My husband said it was a 
definite keeper cake and he wanted it for his bday next year and many 
years to come. YUM!</p>

				<p>I’ve made this cake four times now. It’s always amazing (people 
actually think I’m a “legendary baker” because of this cake–which is an 
actual quote, but nothing close to the truth.) I wanted to share 2 tiny

about a tsp of espresso powder and 2 TB of cake enhancer (basically an 
emulsifier), both items from King Arthur flour. Thanks for this recipe,

				<p>I am new to this blog and look forward to making this cake for my

sent me the recipe to make for her party.  I skimmed the comments

Is it okay to bake, ice, and glaze the cake the day before its being 
served?  And I assume it would remain in the frig the entire time as 
well as any leftovers?  I hope so.  Thanks!</p>

				<p>I made this cake in stages. The cake layers on Wednesday &amp; 
finished,and served it on Friday. I followed the recipe to a T, 
including the chilling between frostings.<br>
This is an incredibly rich cake. A sliver is all you can eat. It is a show stopper.<br>
My preference however is still a really good coffee cake.</p>

				<p>I’ve wanted to make this cake ever since I saw it on your site 
over a year ago but it totally intimidated me! Today I finally bit the 
bullet. Had a little trouble with the cakes the first time–they just 
didn’t rise for some reason I couldn’t figure out. But tried again and 
perfection! In fact, the cake really is sky high–it didn’t fit in my 
cake holder it was so tall. The PB frosting is totally to die for – 
can’t wait to sample the whole cake tomorrow! Thank you for the great 
recipe and super clear instructions! There’s pictures and notes on my

<p>It was so good, my best friend forgave me for baking my own birthday 
cake. So good I just looked this up again to make a cupcake version this
 weekend. So good I can picture sinking my teeth into it. So good I will
 probably spend the next 20 minutes reading and re-reading this page

				<p>I made this cake for my common-law husband’s birthday this week. 
Our friends went bananas and have decided that I should open a bake shop
 and sell nothing but this cake. I’ll admit, this cake is pretty much 
all that I can think of eating for breakfast today… and yesterday too. 
This is one professional quality dessert.</p>
<p>I made a few alterations – Omitted 1 cup of icing sugar in the peanut
 butter frosting and also used pure peanut butter. I added a tablespoon 
of corn starch to thicken things up and a teaspoon of salt. These 
changes reduced a bit of the sweetness which seemed to highlight the 
peanut butter flavor.</p>
<p>I followed the freezing and chilling recommendations, and it was a 
breeze to assemble, frost and ganache. The chocolate cake was so moist 
that it really needed to be frozen to work with.</p>
<p>2/2 recipes that I’ve used from your site have been hits with my foodie family and friends. Thanks so much.</p>

				<p>FANTASTIC!My daughter and I made this cake for her husband’s 
b/day after searching his two favorite eats – peanut butter and 
chocolate. Huge hit. So huge in fact we shared it with the neighbors. 
Plenty to go around. </p>
<p>Used 6oz semisweet and 2oz unsweetened chocolate in glaze – less sweet.<br>
Substituted Lyle’s Golden Syrup for yucky corn syrup. </p>
<p>We followed the freezing and chilling – no problem icing the cake.<br>
Thanks. Love your site. Can’t go wrong w/ Smitten Kitchen.</p>

				<p>This cake is a sneaky-ass bomb and we loved it. Made it for my 
co-workers for my birthday (a concept they did not understand, try as I 
might to explain that making my own cake is part of my gift to myself) 
and served it in small wedges. Everyone raved about it and I was very 
happy to pass along Smitten Kitchen as the source.</p>
<p>— Yogurt instead of sour cream in the cake worked perfectly. So did half AP flour, half white whole wheat.<br>
— A single eight ounce package of cream cheese, plus a couple big 
spoonsful of plain yogurt, worked great in the peanut butter frosting. I
 added a few big pinches of salt to the frosting and the glaze, too, and
 I think up to a quarter teaspoon in each would be appropriate.<br>
— The big change: since I foolishly gave away my small round pans, I 
baked most of the batter in a quarter sheet pan and the rest in a loaf 
pan. (No measuring needed for the conversion, just eyeballing.) I used a
 pot lid to score it, then cut out the two layers after I chilled it. A 
two-layer, seven-inch cake was plenty for seven adults. I cobbled the 
other big scraps together and frosted and glazed their tops for our own 
treat at home and gave the plain loaf to my co-worker as a thank-you.</p>
<p>Looks like you might get over 1,000 comments on this one by year’s 
end if the rising cost of peanut butter doesn’t get too prohibitive.  :D</p>
<p>Delicious, Deb. Thanks again!</p>

				<p>I had to force myself to actually assemble the cake because the 
peanut butter frosting and chocolate peanut butter glaze were SO GOOD by
 themselves. I could seriously live in a bowl of both and be happy 
forever. i was a little hesitant to make this because it looked like a 
lot of steps, but it was not difficult at all. i made the cakes last 
night and froze them wrapped in wax paper and saran wrap, and then made 
the frostings today and assembled. icing it was simple – no issues with 
crumbs or anything! deb thanks for the recipe! i’ve made probably 25 
things from your website and every single one has turned out absolutely 
perfectly.</p>

				<p>Hi Deb-<br>
QUICK question-<br>
I am very excited to see all of these comments- and to try this cake out for myself (for quite an important dinner!).<br>
I am a fan of a heavy wet cake- love the sour cream in chocolate cake 
too! I always add a package of instant jello chocolate pudding, and a 
container of sour cream, to my chocolate cakes, along with some 
chocolate chips (just to melt in there…). </p>
<p>Do you think I could add the chips and instant pudding to this cake? I’m so curious to try it!</p>
<p>Just want to add that I think you’re a genius. And your site is beautiful and the best on the web,<br>
Cheers from Toronto,Canada,<br>
Kate</p>

				<p>I have had this cake bookmarked for 2 years and FINALLY made it. 
 It is absolutely wonderful.  I used Hershey “Special Dark” cocoa powder
 and the cake came out very dark, almost black in color.  It is so moist
 and has a lovely crumb.  I used the sour cream and made 3 layers.  This
 is a tall cake!  I froze the layers overnight for easier handling, and 
added a good glug of vanilla and generous sprinkle of salt to the 
frosting. I couldn’t imagine glazing it, on top of that rich and 
delicious frosting, so I just used a cake comb to make a pattern.  It is
 really amazingly good. For Kate (comment above)- I really would not try
 to make this cake wetter.  I also love really moist cakes, but this one
 is so moist already, as written, that it might be too mushy with 
pudding added to the cake.  I think you will not be disappointed.  This 
is what a box cake (which I like, in a perverse way) would be if it grew
 up, and was made from scratch.  Same incredible moistness and very fine
 crumb.  But much more chocolately and no off flavors at all.  So, so 
good!</p>

				<p>I can’t believe I haven’t commented on this cake …. it’s AMAZING,
 always a crowd pleaser, and you crave it when you just think about how 
good it was.  It is VERY rich, but it makes it go that much further.  
it’s AMAZING.</p>
<p>Thanks for your site … love our stuff.  SO EXCITED for your book!</p>

				<p>I made this cake for my daughter’s first birthday almost.. Well 
the better part of two months ago and I totally forgot about commenting 
until my grandma requested it for my cousin’s birthday party this 
weekend and I thought I would say… I mean what is there left to say ?? 
My GRANDMA asked ME to make her grandson a birthday cake.. Don’t they 
have a magic recipe book somewhere for this kinda stuff ??? Well 
obviously it doesn’t have THIS cake in it ;). But in all honestly its 
amazing. It’s moist and SO chocolately and rich but not like a “I need a
 glass of milk with this” and gewwy and moist and DELICIOUS !!! Has 
anyone every watched the part of the Metilda movie where the principle 
makes the boy eat the cake and it somehow looks so scrumptious and 
sticky moist ?? THIS.IS.THAT.CAKE !!! I can’t say enough but Kate (from 
above) I would DEFINENTLY not add the pudding ! I myself absolutely LOVE
 partially melted chocolate chips is cupcakes, muffins and cakes and if 
your prefer that in yours too I would say DO IT.. They would be PERFECT 
in this cake.. Sorry for all the caps words but this cake makes you want
 to be over the top exlamitory-ish and I can’t say enough about this 
cake !</p>

				<p>I made it exactly as written including all the recommended 
chilling and it turned out perfect. Usually on a recipe with so many 
steps and parts I’ll screw up somewhere but this turned out flawless and
 I had a piece right out of the fridge and one after letting it sit as 
recommended and it’s like night and day. Much better at room 
temperature, you get a lot more of the peanut butter flavor out of it. 
Chilled it’s fantastic too but the chocolate completely dominates.</p>

				<p>I love this cake. Not because I’ve eaten it (because honestly I 
haven’t had a slice) but because everyone else loves it! I was looking 
for a little challenge back in May for a friends cake. He likes 
chocolate &amp; peanut butter. This cake has such richness of both 
(&amp; stellar pictures) so it was chosen! I’ve made for him twice now, 
once for his birthday &amp; once at cost for his coworkers farewell 
party. They had a sample of it when he brought in the leftovers &amp; 
went raving mad over it. I’ll be making it agin this morning! This cake 
has gotten everyone a little nutty (punny aren’t I?)! Thanks for posting
 such detailed steps!</p>

				<p>My son and I made this last night and it was wonderful.  I 
substituted half the oil for applesauce and half the chocolate for Dark 
Chocolate.  I also chilled the frosting while the cake layers were in 
the freezer and thought I would do the crumb layer and chill again , but
 found it wasn’t neccessary – it frosted wih no crumb problems at all.  
It was perfectly moist and the icing was great – I usually scrape the 
icing off cakes, but I could eat extra of this icing since it didn’t 
taste so sweet.</p>

				<p>I made this last year for my husband’s birthday. Yesterday I

didn’t bookmark the recipe so I was afraid I wouldn’t be able to find it
 again. Your was the first link that came up in my search and I KNEW it

				<p>Am looking at this cake at 12.40am when kids and husband are 
asleep and actually felt like traipsing down to the kitchen to make the 
cake!! But I’m afraid I might actually eat the whole cake by myself so I
 will wait till daylight. And then I’m afraid I still might eat the 
whole cake by myself so in an effort to save whatever is left of my 
girlish figure, I’m wondering if I should half the recipe and make it 
into a chocolate swiss roll with peanut butter cream cheese filling 
instead (since you said the cake was soft, I figured it will be easy to 
roll). Hmmm…</p>

				<p>I made this cake last weekend for a friend’s birthday (he loves 
peanut butter) and it turned out AMAZING! thank you so much for the 
clear instructions on how to make this fabulous cake…. i’m new to baking
 cakes so was a bit worried, especially since i used cake pans with a 
removable bottom and lost half the batter! on the plus side i didn’t 
even need to level the cakes, i had 3 equal flat layers… love your site

				<p>I have made this cake twice since January and it is truly 
sensational!   The ganache can be used completely separately as a 
chocolate spread (like nutella but without hazelnuts) which is great 
since my daughter has a hazelnut allergy but loves peanut butter.  I am 
planning to make it again tomorrow for my dad’s birthday.  Fantastic!</p>

				<p>Here in mumbai, I cut the recipe in half and made them as 
cupcakes successfully. The cake really is delicate and moist and lovely 
and the frosting is a beautiful surprising flavour. The tanginess works 
beautifully and it melts in your mouth.. rich and light at the same 
time. I did find the three put together a tad too rich and found that 
the chocolate glaze seized every time I added the corn syrup..not sure 
why. I used Karo…is there something I was doing wrong?<br>
On the other hand, given that the cupcakes though delicious, bordered on
 a tad too rich, I think the glaze maybe an overkill on them. I did 
drizzle them with a bit of melted chocolate mixed with peanut butter 
though. Here is the post…<br>

				<p>My first time posting to tell you what a smitten Deb fan I am.  I’m a fairly new<br>
baker and wanted to make a birthday cake for a friend’s brunch. I asked her<br>
what her favorite flavors were and she said chocolate and peanut butter.<br>
Perfect! I wanted to make this cake. I took the cake to the brunch, where the<br>
dozen women, who among them don’t consume more than 1000 calories a week<br>
scarfed down this cake. There was a 6 month old baby there and the cake<br>
got more’oohs’ and ‘ahhs’ than the baby! Fantastic cake. Thanks Deb!</p>

				<p>AMAZING. This was the best cake ever! I made it for my husband’s 
40th birthday and it was outstanding. He’s a chocolate &amp; peanut 
butter connoisseur as well as a fantastic cook, so this was the perfect 
dessert. I especially appreciated the detailed instructions; I can hold 
my own with cooking, but baking has always eluded me. I had my 
reservations about making this cake since I’m a baking novice, but the 
worry was all for naught. The end result wasn’t quite as pretty as 
yours, but this was hands down one of the best birthday cakes we’ve ever
 had. Thanks SK for another fabulous recipe!</p>

				<p>I’ll add to your comment galore :)</p>
<p>I just finished making this cake for a friend’s birthday this weekend
 and decided I should do a “test cake” before I made a “real” one for 32
 people…</p>
<p>OH MY LANTA!<br>
This knocked our socks off! Not even kidding! I’m not a huge peanut 
butter fan, but if it has chocolate I’m so game. I almost switched out 
this chocolate cake for my normal recipe I use…and I am so flippin glad I
 didn’t! This was ridiculously good! I’m a stickler about moist cakes 
and this is like a melt in your mouth goodness that blew me away.<br>
The peanut butter frosting seriously tasted like whipped fudge. Holy 
crap. I normally make my frosting the night before so it has time to sit
 before I pipe it and spread but this wasn’t needed…in fact it kind of 
turned into fudge after sitting in the fridge overnight. I literally had
 to rewhip it on high with my kitchen aid for five minutes. But it still
 tastes amaaaaazing. And when it sets on the face it’s perfect. Not rock
 hard or too sloppy it falls off. </p>
<p>I had a terribly time icing the cakes though. I suck at spreading 
icing anyways so I anticipated this but the cake is so moist it was 
impossible for me since I can hardly do it with a dry cake let alone 
this moist wonderfulness. </p>
<p>My only complaint is the glaze. I used 8 oz of Nestle semisweet chips
 and melted everything in a wilton chocolate melting pot which was 
amazingly easier than a double boiler, but I had to add a little extra 
corn syrup and about 3 TBS of confectioners sugar to it. It still tasted
 great but on a piped cake the chocolate dripping just looks like a hot 
mess :( So we’re going to serve it on the side as an “option” (that of 
course everybody will more than likely devour by itself). </p>
<p>I want to say THANK YOU times a million. My best friend LOVES peanut 
butter and chocolate and originally found a wedding cake on pinterest 
with this style which is what lead me to this recipe…I will make this 
for any person breathing and I’m pretty sure it’ll be the best thing 
they’ve ever had.<br>
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU! I’ve been looking so hard to find a 
perfect recipe for her cake and I found it plus nine million other 
friends as well :)</p>

				<p>Quick question about the layers – (choc/peanut butter cake)  I 
see where you say you can freeze them 1/2 hr. before frosting, but I’m 
having a dinner party in a week and wanted to bake the layers maybe 3 
days before and wrap/freeze?  Can I do this or are the layers too soft 
and fragile?  Thanks! (Too many comments to find an answer!)</p>

				<p>Joni — You can totally freeze them as long as you need to as long
 as they are well wrapped. Getting them all or partially frozen makes 
them easier to handle when you want to fill and frost the cake.</p>

				<p>I bake birthday cakes/cupcakes all the time for my colleagues at 
work, and we always enjoy them together. I brought this cake in today 
for a birthday celebration, and people were RAVING about how great it 
is. It’s beautiful, easy to make, great instructions, and SUCH a crowd 
pleaser! I’ll definitely keep this in my recipe book to use again – 
thanks!!!!</p>

 Super moist, super tasty, and a crowd pleaser. I scored mega points for

				<p>Made the cake for dinner party last nite – without a doubt, the 
best cake I ever made (or ate)!  Everyone loved it.  Reminds me of the 
cake I bought for my son’s grad party made by CIA-trained bakers at a 
local bakery – cost $200!   This was equally as good! Thanks so much for
 the recipe!</p>

				<p>WoW!  Not that enough has not already been said above but this 
cake is amazing.  I stumbled on it with a Google search.  I made this 
last night for a birthday celebration this morning.  It was amazing!  I 
put the layers in the freezer for several hours and had no trouble with 
frosting the frozen layes and I also shaved off a thin layer to make 
them even.  I had too much chocolate and it covered so much of the sides
 I went ahead and covered the entire cake in the chocolate glaze.  Did I
 say WOW!  My new favorite cake.</p>

				<p>Omg this is seriously the BEST chocolate cake ever. I added about
 two tablespoons of espresso powder to the dry mixture and sprinkled 
bacon on top at the end! </p>
<p>My first attempt turned out pretty crumbly. (But still DELICIOUS!) I 
totally lost an entire layer because it fell apart. I’m sure this goes 
without saying for you avid bakers out there, but cut the rounded tops 
off each of the cakes before attempting to stack this! O_o I’m not much 
of a baker at all, so this didn’t even occur to me.</p>
<p>Thanks for posting! Even with my mishaps, it made for a fab cake for my boyfriend’s birthday!</p>

say that is by far the most insanely amazing chocolate cake I’ve ever 
made. I used a different pb frosting recipe but after ogling over this 
cake since the day you posted it (I’m a loong time reader) I’m SO happy 
to have finally made it! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with

				<p>I made this cake this passed weekend for a family dinner. I knew 
as soon as I tried it that this was the dessert to make, because 
everyone on my husband’s side of the family LOVES the chocolate peanut 
butter combo (not that I don’t, but I’m just not as wild about it.) 
Anyway, it was a hit, as I knew it would be. The cake was lovely and 
moist, even after it had spent a day in the fridge (don’t worry- I 
frosted it first.) Everything turned out just as described, and I, as a 
novice cake baker, was thrilled. Freezing the cooled cake layers before 
frosting was super helpful. Also, cooling the chocolate peanut butter 
ganache (10-15 minutes) before pouring over the top of the cake helped. I
 got mini peanut butter cups and chopped them up and threw those on top 
of the cake for a finishing touch, as if we needed to get anymore 
outrageous. It added a very pleasing texture. Thanks a lot, Deb! I love 
your site, your recipes, and have way much fun reading them (and a lot 
of fun making this one.)</p>

				<p>I have made this cake for my husband 3 times now, 2 birthdays and
 1 graduation, with excellent results each time except for the 2 times I
 *did not* have parchment to line my pans.  Yes, the parchment is a must
 since this cake is so delicate, but even if it it crumbles and falls 
apart, like mine did, and the littles munch away at all the pieces, like
 mine did, a little time in the freezer and lots of forgiving peanut 
butter frosting and ganache will repair the mess and leave a great 
presentation despite the broken innards.  Chilling the cake again before
 serving will help hold it all together when slicing to serve. I think 
leaving a little PB frosting on the side for piping rosettes or whirls 
on top with a chocolate covered peanut planted in the center would be a 
nice finish too. Thanks for the* best* recipe ever!!!</p>

				<p>I just made this cake and I can’t wait to dig in! The frosting is
 simply divine and so easy to make — I’m already thinking of other 
recipes to use it in. I have to admit that I usually don’t make 
oil-based cakes and was honestly concerned when I saw how runny the 
batter was. No worries though, the cake set perfectly when cooked, and 
came out quite delicate and soft. Freezing is a necessity and makes 
handling the cake and frosting possible. Thanks for posting a fantastic 
recipe, I can already tell that this is going to be a family staple and 
give German Chocolate a run for its money as family favorite.</p>

				<p>Dear Deb, I feel like you should be as relieved and overjoyed as I
 am right now!  I have been slaving away for weeks over here, planning 
and finally executing a surprise half-birthday party for my Husband.  
And i have read and re-read this recipe probably 276 times in the past 
month.  I pretty much had the whole thing memorized by the time I made 
my cake.  But, that was the point, wasn’t it?  My busband’s birthday is a
 day before mine, and I’m kind of a brat about it.  Especially this 
year, as it was what some might call a “land mark” birthday for me, I 
almost totally ignored his birthday.  So, throwing  a half-brirthday 
event seemed the least i could do.  My husband would have married 
Peanutbutter-and-chocolate if it had ever decided to throw away its 
other nine million suitors and stay with him, but it just couldn’t, so 
he got me instead.  And you and me and this cake, we win!! I bake a lot 
of things.  Cakes are not on the list.  Layer cakes are certainly not on
 the list.  My sister had to explain to me what exactly butter cream was
 several months ago (she shuddered, as should you).  But  I DID IT!  And
 so Thank You, thank you! (And maybe i’ll see you at the DC Book Event!)
  As for nerdy notes, I baked my cakes last week, wrapped and froze 
them; I halved the recipe and used 6 inch pans, we served 8 slices and 
have a quarter of the cake left! I pretty much did everything else by 
the book.  You are a rock star.</p>

				<p>This cake has been a favorite in our house for several years now 
including our daughters HS graduation party in 2010.  She and her friend
 loved this cake so much they experimented with making it into filled 
&amp; iced cupcakes and decorated with fondant flowers to coordinate 
with her party theme. YES, they were Amazing! Chocolate cake filled with
 delicious CCPB frosting,  topped with CCPB and chocolate ganache. To 
celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary in March our girls threw a party 
for us and of course this cake was there. Always amazing. I am reminded 
today as a friend has recently graduated from nursing school and my 
daughter made her this cake to celebrate. She saved us a sliver. WOW! 
You rock!</p>

				<p>I made this cake a few times and everytime it was a hit.  The 
cake is sooo moist, I use the cake recipe for cupcakes and delicious.  
Makes too much so I have to 1/2 the recipe.  I made the cake once for my
 mom but I diddn’t have round cake pans so i made it into huge sheet 
cake and just 1/4 it and stacked it.  It was a huge cake but my mom ate 
the WHOLE cake within 24 hrs!!!</p>

				<p>Hi! This cake recipe has been my go to chocolate cake recipe ever
 since I found it. Unfortunately I have moved to the UK and am having a 
hard time finding plain distilled white vinegar. The closest I get is a 
distilled malt vinegar…and I strongly believe that it’s made the cake 
taste too sweet. Is there a substitute I can use for the vinegar? 
Possibly lemon juice??? Or will the cake be fine without the vinegar?</p>

				<p>I made this cake last night for my roommates birthday. The only 
thing I changed was the filling of the cake. I felt the frosting was so 
sweet and peanut-buttery, it might over power the chocolatey taste of 
the cake. So instead of filling the layers with the frosting I made a 
plain chocolate ganache and sprinkled chopped mini peanut butter cups on
 top. It complemented the cake perfect and did not have an over whelming
 peanut butter taste. It had a great balance of peanut butter and 
chocolate flavor. It was a huge hit at the party! Will definitely be 
using this recipe again!</p>

				<p>With over 1,000 comments it’s got to be good, right? Oh yes, it 
was good! I’ve been cooking from the cookbook, but I’ve always wanted to
 make this cake and figured my birthday would be the perfect time to do 
it. I’m so glad I did! Phenomenal cake! I added a bit of salt to the 
peanut butter frosting to get it more like the filling of a peanut 
butter cup, so yummy! I could have eaten a bowl of it!</p>

				<p>My boyfriend requested this cake for his birthday, so the 
pressure was on! Your tip to freeze the layers worked well. I ended up 
using an 8 inch square pan for my third layer and it worked out pretty 
well, although next time I’ll actually attempt to use one of the round 
pans as a cutting guide instead of eye-balling it. Frosting aided in 
hiding that little slip-up.  Thanks for the great recipe and tips! It 
helped me get over my fear of layer cake creation. :)</p>

				<p>I have made this cake and was told this has become “THE” party 
cake! (This means I have to make it for every party, holiday, etc.) 
Would you mind if I pinned the link to your website for this recipe it

				<p>I have made this once before and it was AMAZING! I now have the 
task for baking for a baby shower at work. I’d like to make this, but we
 are expecting at least 40 people. I am thinking about making cupcakes 
in addition to the layer cake, as is. Do you have suggestions for making
 this as cupcakes (I’m wondering about the logistics for adding the 
glaze over the icing). Or do you have another suggestion of how to make 
enough of this for 40 people? Any help is greatly appreciated! Thanks!!</p>

				<p>Know what would be a good idea? Make the peanut butter 
cheesecake-y frosting a little firmer and dip lollipop/popsicle sticks 
in it. then dip in chocolate. found this idea on pinterest:<br>

				<p>Please remove the directions that say you can use wax paper 
rather than parchment paper to line the cake pans.  About 5 minutes 
after putting the cake pans in the oven our house filled with smoke.  We
 had to take the cakes out and put them in new pans.  Hopefully they 
turn out, but it would have saved a lot of trouble if we had used 
parchment paper, or just the cake pans.</p>

				<p>Hi Haley — So the paper burned? I do usually prefer and recommend
 parchment, however, waxed paper covered with cake batter should not 
burn unless the cake itself does.</p>

				<p>delicious. i reduced the sugar to 1 and 3/4 cups and oil to 3/4 
cups in the cake batter, and the confectioner’s sugar to 4 cups in the 
frosting. used sugar syrup instead of corn syrup for the glaze. 2 layers
 instead of 3. it was amazing…thanks for another great recipe.</p>

				<p>I just made this cake for the 4th time, and mmm it’s delicious 
already. I know this, because I made it in a (possibly poorly greased??)
 bundt cake pan and when I turned the cake out, it left it’s ‘shell’ 
behind in the pan for lucky me. The cake looks rather ugly, though, but 
the frosting will help it out. For those of you using bundt cake pans, 
don’t do what I did! As was mentioned many many times :) this cake is 
really REALLY soft! I do love it, even though I’ve had many 
cake-astrophes with it. Any tips how I can successfully bake this in a 
bundt pan? It baked for about 45 minutes and I cooled it for about 5-10 
minutes.</p>

				<p>I made this last night/today for a coworkers birthday. It was a 
HUGE hit. My first attempt at a 3 layer cake and I couldn’t have been 
more pleased. I was worried at first that my batter was too thin, 
however, the cakes came out perfect. One piece of advice for anyone 
reading this… small pieces. You start off thinking not rich and then 
half way through you are saying… oh my!!!! Also agreed about having a 
glass of cold milk handy. That would have set if off perfect. Thank you 
for sharing this most delish receipe. I will make this again and again 
and again!!</p>

				<p>hi deb!  making this cake for the first time and feeling shocked 
that i’ve never come across it before – we are BIG peanut butter 
chocolate people in our family.</p>
<p>the cakes are cooling now and i’m wondering this – did you freeze the
 layers before you turned them out of the pans?  or after?  i’m loving 
that suggestion – to freeze the layers before working with them – just 
wondering if i should do that even before i turn them out of the pans.  
any advice will be most welcome!</p>

				<p>Just wanted to add my two cents to say I made for my boyfriend’s 
birthday and everyone absolutely ADORED it. We had maybe 25-30 people 
over and the cake easily fed everyone with some leftover.</p>
<p>@Emily: I think that Deb’s instructions say to turn out the cakes 
before you freeze them… but I can’t fit a wire rack in my freezer so I 
put the cake pans straight in the freezer after they cooled to room temp
 and then inverted the cakes after freezing them for about 30 min. 
Worked perfectly and the parchment came right off.</p>

				<p>Just made this for my husband’s birthday – and I quote ‘this was 
exactly wanted I wanted’. I used caster sugar and cut it back to 500 
grams.  I also substituted 70% dark chocolate for the semi-sweet as I 
thought the darker chocolate would offset the amount of sugar in the 
cake and frosting.  I also used fresh ground whole foods peanutbutter 
which worked perfectly. (The frosting was dangerously close to seizing 
but came out fine). I suspect this will be a repeat birthday cake.  
Thanks as always for your wonderful blog!  If possible, I would be a 
huge fan of you adding weight of ingredients for your baking recipes 
(rather than cups),</p>

				<p>2 things:</p>
<p>1. Made this for a family Christmas gathering and it was such a hit 
that, as were divying up leftovers, my stepmother took the remaining 
cake home with her and would not share it with anyone, even my Dad.</p>
<p>2. Made this again for my birthday, only used a white chocolate 
butter cream and left the peanut butter out of the ganache. Brought the 
leftover cake into work and a co-worker has asked me to recreate it for 
her husband’s birthday. I have never been asked to make a cake for 
anyone before in my life and I think she asked because that ganache 
topping is genius presentation. You cannot look at that and not think, 
“Yummy decadence”. It’s also genius for the baker as it hides any 
imperfections and is so stinking simple! I don’t know if you came up 
with that or Sky High but it is absolute genius and has made me the star
 of my office. Thank you for sharing this, as well as the chilling 
tips-I may never pipe a cake again!</p>

				<p>I just put the cakes into the freezer now, so I haven’t put it 
all together yet, but I tasted a piece of the cake and all I taste is 
the canola oil. I’m hoping the frostings will mask this when I put it 
all together, but so far…I would NOT use canola oil in this again. I 
really wish I had used some applesauce with a different type of oil. I 
will report back with the finished result.</p>

				<p>Ron — I don’t have a single one. I have few quibbles with the 
Trader Joe’s pound-plus bars if you’re looking to spend less. I’d say my
 go-to is most often Guittard brand. I can buy 1-pound boxes of their 
discs (which are like large, flat chocolate chips, can be used whole or 
chopped or melted, come in all percentages and white) for $8 to $9, 
which feels like a good price for great chocolate. I sometimes buy 
Scharffen-Berger and Valrhona, but less often.</p>

				<p>This is my new favorite cake and I didn’t think I liked peanut 
butter desserts! I dream about this cake now, LOL! I am planning to make
 it again this weekend for my Dad’s birthday but I am going to try a 
coconut almond version instead of the peanut butter (because my Mom 
isn’t a fan of peanut butter). If you’re debating whether to make this 
cake or not MAKE IT you won’t be sorry!!! I also plan to use the 
chocolate cake recipe for now on when making any kinda of chocolate 
cake, it was amazingly moist!</p>

				<p>hey Deb!<br>
Just curious: I haven’t made the cake yet – but my brain gets hung up on
 the oil &amp; water… instinctively I want to add butter and whole milk!
 Is there a reason behind those ingredients? Do you find they produce a 
more moist cake? Just curious! Though it helps in calories, I don’t mind
 my cake to be an indulgence… ;) As well – what effect does the vinegar 
have in the baking? I haven’t seen that in a cake recipe before, and am 
also curious at the effect the ingredient has in the baking process! 
Thanks so much! I am always hunting for new recipes, and looking for 
ways to improve the recipes I have!<br>
Cheers!</p>

				<p>Made this cake. Wow.<br>
Here’s what I posted on my FB page:</p>
<p>This cake is BY FAR the BEST cake I’ve EVER made.<br>
Made it with my 4 year old daughter for DH’s birthday.<br>
It is above and beyond. It is divine. It is moist. It is peanut-y. It is DELICIOUS.<br>
It took me a long time (like, all day, not to mention prepping), 
especially with the kids helping, but was worth every moment of every 
stressful incident.<br>
If you decide to make it, I commend you; but…<br>
Buckle. Up.<br>
And do NOT be on a diet if you make it.</p>

				<p>I have baked this cake three times now. Thank you, thank you, 
thank you, for sharing the recipe! I have the book now and have made a 
couple other cakes from it, but this is my no brainer cake… as in its so
 good that when I have a choice between this cake and any other it’s a 
no brainer to pick this one ;)</p>

				<p>Deb, I will forever remember this cake as the one that broke your
 website when you posted the recipe and pictures. I just made it again, 
but with the chocolate butter cake you used for your wedding cake since I
 didn’t have all the ingredients for this chocolate cake. It was 
amazing, as always, and that peanut butter cream cheese frosting is 
still the best peanut butter frosting I have ever tasted; I have a 
tendency to just eat the leftover frosting out of the bowl with my 
finger.</p>
<p>I’m embarrassed to say that the first time I attempted this cake, 
very soon after your posted it, I actually forgot to add the sugar to 
the bowl! Somehow, no one tasted the batter before we put it in the 
oven, so everything was all fine and dandy until we cut into the frosted
 and decorated cake and everyone took their first bite. Whoops! We tried
 to salvage it by dumping powdered sugar on the top of the individual 
slices, but I think in the end we gave up on that and just picked off 
the frosting and ate that instead.</p>

				<p>Have just read the more-than-a-thousand comments and feel like 
I’ve put on some pounds already.  My questions:  1.  Why smooth/creamy 
peanutbutter rather than chunky?  (It is what we usually eat.)  Wouldn’t
 it give the frosting a nice little crunch?  2. What is the AP in “AP 
flour”?</p>

				<p>Golly, I just put on at least 5 pounds in the one slice I had.  
One word, amazing.  As for the previous commentor, I would use 
creamy/smooth peanut butter because you wouldn’t want the glaze to be 
chunky, you want it to be glossy and smooth.  AP refers to all purpose 
flour as opposed to cake or high gluten flour.</p>

				<p>Geez, not sure I need to add another comment to the over 1000 , 
but I’ll leave my review since I always scroll to the bottom of comments
 to get real reviews of recipes. Made this yesterday in 2 round 9in 
pans. Followed most of the recipe except subbing greek yogurt for sour 
cream (it’s what I had available) and melted coconut oil for the veg oil
 since I don’t use those types of oils. Came out amazing! Thank for a 
recipe to celebrate my husbands birthday. Wish we could add photos to 
comments so you could see it.</p>

				<p>Huge peanut butter and chocolate fan but this cake is way too 
rich. If i were to make it again i’d definitely skip the peanut butter 
frosting all over the outside of the cake and just coat it completely in
 the chocolate peanut butter glaze. </p>
<p>The chocolate cake itself is already most and rich, it doesn’t need 
all of the excess frosting. The peanut butter frosting in-between each 
layer is more than enough to get the taste of the peanut butter and 
really make the cake more edible.</p>
<p>SM isn’t kidding when she says you can eat only a small piece of this
 cake! it’s because of the huge amount of this peanut butter frosting 
which is all over the outside of the cake and completely un-necessary.</p>

				<p>Jeanne — AP = all-purpose flour. If you’d like to use chunky 
peanut butter, give it a spin. The recipe’s creator and myself just 
preferred it smooth.</p>

				<p>Wow Deb. This cake is amazing. I made it yesterday for my friends
 birthday. I completely underestimated the size… And your comments on 
how many it feeds! We’ve taken 1/4 of the cake out, that’s 7 slices… And
 we all felt sick by the end of our slices!! Never have I not been able 
to go back for seconds. </p>
<p>Such an impressive, tasty cake though. I think this cake would do brilliantly for fundraising events/cake sales!!</p>

				<p>Wow! I made this for my birthday yesterday (which to me is a very
 acceptable thing to do). I’m very picky about my cake; I don’t like 
most cakes. This one was texturally pleasing and very satisfying on the 
flavor front. One of my guests also doesn’t like chocolate cake and he 
said it was the first one he actually liked.</p>
<p>The only problem is that 12 of us ate half of it, and so now I have 
half an cake that (so far) is keeping very nicely. I think I’m going to 
eat nothing but cake for the next few days.</p>

				<p>Whoah, yeah!  I made a variation on this a couple of years ago, 
and up until this past week, that was talked about in hushed tones 
amongst those who were there to cram as much into their faces as they 
could.  But you see, this past week, I made this version (albeit with 
twice as much PB), and it has surpassed that, legendary cake.  I found 
that this made a lot of batter, too much for Three layers really, enough
 for a (skimpy) fourth layer in fact.  And plenty of PB frosting to 
boot.  </p>
<p>Oh, I too froze the cake layers overnight, wrapped in cling film, and
 panicked that they wouldn’t defrost in time for serving, but needn’t 
have worried; as rich as the cake is, the layers are that light and 
moist, that they pretty much defrosted as I assembled the cake.  I can 
see why it is recommended to freeze them for easier decoration.</p>

				<p>Made this yesterday.  It was PHENOMENAL.  I used 9in square cake 
pans (and because I can’t visually measure very well, one layer was 
especially healthy….) and it turned out about 6in tall.  I also used 
half AP and half cake flour, cuz i was feeling experimental.  Half the 
cake fed six very hearty eaters.  I sent the other half home with a 
guest because I didn’t want to find out if it would serve one. :-)  Yum.</p>

chocolate going dry? If chocolate is overcooked (it burns easily), it 
will seem gritty and maybe greasy and there’s little that can be done to
 fix it.</p>

				<p>Hi Deb! I made this cake exactly a year ago for a friend’s 
birthday, and it was such a huge hit that we didn’t have any cake left 
over at the end of the party! I’m planning to make it again this weekend
 for another friend’s birthday, and have been searching for corn syrup 
in all of the supermarkets and the like (I’m now living in Chile). I 
finally decided to search your comments and the internet to see if 
anyone has suggestions or alternatives and am happy to see that you 
recommend using honey or golden syrup. Thanks so much for the comment. I
 hope it’s just as much of a success tomorrow night as it was last year!
 Thanks so much!</p>

				<p>Deb, Just made this as cupcakes (split and filled with PB frosting) and am so pleased with the results!</p>
<p>My tweaks: in place of the PB frosting, I beat peanut butter into my 
left-over cream cheese frosting from your carrot cake recipe (which I 
also made, and which also turned out great. Only comment is that the 
frosting recipe was about double what I needed….which I obviously put to
 good use.) </p>
<p>In place of the chocolate frosting, I made the ganache recipe from here (I wanted to avoid having to buy corn syrup): <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/04/peanut-butter-chocolate-mousse-layer-cake-recipe.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/04/peanut-butter-chocolate-mousse-layer-cake-recipe.html</a> (chocolate, heavy cream, PB). It was runny but fantastic. </p>
<p>The cakes were delicious. They did sink quite a bit, but that was covered by frosting.</p>

				<p>Hi Deb, I finally made this cake for a family party.  My MIL, who
 is hyper-critical of everything, told me it was the best thing she had 
ever eaten.  THANK YOU!! I have now ordered the book :)  </p>
<p>I didn’t read the comments section, and I only have 3 9″ cake pans.  I
 multiplied the recipe by 1 1/2.  It fit in the pans perfectly and was 
ridiculously high.  That being said, this was a party with about 30 
people, most of whom brought a bakery coffee cake of some sort with 
them, as well as one huge, fancy, expensive bakery cake for a 50th 
anniversary.  Only 1/4 of this cake remained at the end, and everything 
else was barely touched (really, there were abotu 20 desserts out!)  I 
was a little sad – I had hoped to share tons of leftovers with my 
coworkers. </p>
<p>I loved how the chocolate cake wasn’t too chocolatey. It was absolutely perfect with the rich icing and the ganache.</p>

				<p>Hi! I made this cake for a friend’s birthday and it turned out 
excellent. It was quite scrumptious, but we did have a glaze/ganache 
fail. Sadly, the chocolate/peanut butter/corn syrup mixture completely 
seized and there was no hope of recovery. What we ended up doing was 
Alton Browns easy chocolate ganache and to be truthful, I think the 
extra peanut butter in the glaze would have really put the cake over the
 top. Thanks for the recipe, the birthday girl was very happy.</p>

				<p>Question!! This is, and forever will be, my go to chocolate cake.
 I’ve used it many times with all different fillings and frosting a, it 
is fabulous! My question is, would this cake work as a bundt cake?</p>

				<p>Made this cake for my niece’s 18th birthday and it was a big hit.
 We cut it into 16 slices, which seemed like the perfect size. I was 
worried that the cake wouldn’t be chocolate-y enough, but I actually 
thought it was delicious, and a perfect complement to the frosting and 
glaze. The best compliment I got (among many!) was when my step-son (a 
teenager of few words, and even fewer complimentary words) took a 
hesitant bite and said, oh, this is good, and then took another bite and
 said “this is really good!”. Thanks for the recipe Deb!</p>

				<p>I tried baking this last nite, I dun have 8″ or 9″ pan with me, 
only 7″ pan. So the batter are separated out to 3 7″ pan. The first cake
 didn’t came out well using about 160 degrees celcius and 45 minutes. It
 was bubbling up and the cake is all still runny in the middle. So, my 
second cake I put it about 155 degrees  for about 45 minutes then turn 
to about 160 degrees celcius for another 15 minutes. It takes one whole 
hour to bake a layer. That means I have to bake 3 layers for whole 3 
layers? That seems too long for me. Any advise on this?</p>
<p>Hi, just wondering if you put all 3 pans in the oven at the same 
time, or 2 first, then the other 1 later or one pan at a time in the 
oven? (I’m planning to get 8 or 9 inch pan). Just last one question, is 
this a normal pan or a springform pan you are using?</p>

				<p>You can put all three in at the same time if they fit; you just 
want to rotate the pans around, top to bottom and back to front, to make
 sure they bake evenly.</p>

				<p>I made this cake for my Alex’s birthday and you are totally right
 it is INTENSE – small pieces with lots of milk. I had a hard time with 
them sticking to the pan, but was able to salvage it. I have two 
matching pans, and an odd pan that was a little bit bigger, so it was 
really funny trying to figure out how to stack the layers so it looked 
right. Cake was a big hit, thanks for the recipe!</p>

				<p>Deb – I have this cake cooling now and I will ice it tomorrow for
 my husband’s birthday…a fellow chocoholic with your own husband, so I 
am working my way through your chocolate celebration cake recipes. I 
made the brownie mosaic cheesecake for Father’s Day in June and was told
 it was the best cheesecake he’d ever had and the best dessert I’d ever 
made, so kudos to you!</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the cake at hand. Do you have an approximate amount 
of frosting you used between each layer? I find that I am always stingy 
with the frosting at the beginning and then have gobs left in the end, 
but I’m always so afraid of running out that there is never enough 
between the layers. </p>
<p>Thanks so much! </p>
<p>PS I scrolled through all 1,000+ comments and didn’t see you address 
this issue. I can’t be your only reader concerned with frosting 
distribution, can I??</p>

				<p>You get a gold star for going through all of those comments! I

 and sighed. This is one amazing cake!</p>

				<p>Deb – Thanks so much for your quick and useful response!  It 
turns out I did not even need to worry about not having enough icing.  I
 inadvertently made too much by grabbing my 1/2-cup (instead of 1/3-cup)
 measuring cup when it came time to measure out the peanut butter.  
Thankfully an extra 1/3 cup of peanut never hurt anyone, although it 
turned my light and fluffy icing into something that resembled fondant 
Play Do.  I somehow managed to spread the glob between each layer and 
then literally used my hands to plaster it against the sides and top.  
Thankfully the chocolate ganache covered my handprints beautifully and 
my husband was never the wiser!  </p>
<p>I’m not typically such a spazz in the kitchen, and, while I’m tempted
 to blame my 3.5-year-old “helper”, it wasn’t *totally* her fault, 
although I do think the mental strain of coming up with not-boring jobs 
for the preschool set can force an error from even the most seasoned 
chef!  </p>
<p>But again, my husband never suspected there was a mistake and 
everyone commented on the peanut butter-y-ness of the icing.  Win-win!  
Thanks for another fantastic recipe!</p>

				<p>Thank you so much for this recipe –  hands-down, it’s now my 
favorite cake!  If you like chocolate and peanut butter this one’s 
heaven!  Found I had enough ganache to cover the entire cake, so I might
 reduce the amount next time.  Or maybe not – it’s so sinfully good! :) 
 I followed the recipe exactly.<br>
If anybody is trying this for the first time, do it justice – bring it to room temperature before serving.</p>

				<p>Hello, </p>
<p>Is this recipe on the list to be converted to metric weights? You’ve 
converted me to measuring by weight instead of by volume when baking! </p>
<p>Also, I’m in the UK and am not sure if I can find corn syrup. Would 
you recommend swapping it for golden syrup or leaving it out of the 
ganache entirely? </p>
<p>Thanks so much!</p>

				<p>Finally <a>made this</a> for the man on this birthday but used a

all peanut butter lovers. </p>
<p>Will cut the sugar and add some coffee into the cake next time. Also,
 reading about the comments on adding a bit of salt to the frosting is 
interesting. I hope you will continue to make big celebration cakes and 
share them with us!</p>

				<p>It sounds like several people have also successfully made this 
gluten-free, but thought I’d chime in as well. I used a 1:1 substitution
 with King Arthur AP Gluten-Free Flour (the same mix is found at Trader 
Joe’s under their brand and WAY cheaper). I’ve also made the cake with 
regular flour and literally could not tell the difference. It still had a
 light crumb and tasted amazing and the table was silent through all of 
dessert. I’ve done this with several of your cake recipes for my celiac 
family and they’ve all turned out amazing!</p>

				<p>I made this cake for my son’s birthday on the weekend.  When he 
was a wee lad, I made for his 6th birthday a peanut butter chocolate 
train cake that was featured in a late 80s issue of Gourmet.  I reviewed
 a number of versions of chocolate peanut butter layer cakes on food 
blogs and settled on yours as the one that would be a suitable adult 
version of the childhood memory.  It turned out very well and I wanted 
to let you know.  I have to say I was amazed at the number of positive 
comments this recipe has garnered over the years!  Is this your recipe 
with the most comments, ever!?</p>
<p>I particularly loved the cake recipe.  While I am a huge fan of 
frosting, ganache, butter cream, etc., I was so impressed with the 
lightness, texture and taste of the cake.  </p>
<p>I don’t often make substitutions when making a recipe the first time 
(seems somehow unfair to the creator).  I did this time, however.  I 
used organic 100% peanut butter (no sugar added) and had no trouble with
 oil separation.  As well, I added one extra egg to the cake recipe.  I 
noted your observation about the fragile nature of the cake layers and I
 thought the extra egg might make them a little more sturdy.  They were 
easy to work with.  No freezing required.</p>
<p>Everyone loved the finished result.  Thank you.  I hope to find an 
occasion to make the chocolate /peanut butter cheese cake extravaganza 
sometime soon.</p>

				<p>I made this as cupcakes, and they were absolutely amazing. 18 
minutes to bake, and I cored them so the ganache was inside and the 
peanut butter frosting was on top.  Yielded 32 cupcakes.  Although the 
coring/ganache took a little time (and would be a totally fine step to 
omit, although it did add a crazy delicious oomph) the recipe was quite 
easy overall.  Perfect showstopper dessert for someone like me who is 
great at baking but terrible at decorating!</p>
<p>For anyone deciding between this recipe and the peanut butter brownie
 recipe, I think this recipe edges out the brownies.  I ended up making 
both in the span of a month, and I didn’t think anything could top the 
brownies in the chocolate/pb realm — until I tasted the cupcake.  Both 
recipes are insanely good, but this recipe is just unearthly.</p>

				<p>made this tonight for a chocolate-and-peanut-butter-crazed 
friend’s birthday. it was AMAZINGLY decadent! i made a half recipe and 
got one 9 in round and 6 cupcakes.</p>
<p>i do have to say, a couple things that i didn’t expect freaked me out while baking:<br>
– the batter is REALLY thin. thinner than pancake batter. but it 
blossomed into a light, fluffy cake, so it worked out wonderfully!<br>
– the cake itself is not very chocolatey. it’s not very strong in flavor
 at all. buuuut once you add the frosting and glaze, you NEED that less 
chocolatey cake, or you would die. it’s already so rich.<br>
– when i was making the glaze, before adding the half and half, i had a 
thick, unspreadable paste. minor panic. but then the half and half made 
it go perfectly smooth and drizzly and all was well.</p>
<p>lesson learned: never doubt the marvelous deb. she has yet to steer me wrong. =)</p>

				<p>Deb, I feel like a horrible person even asking this, but do you 
think I could make the ganache with fat free half and half? I have a 
tomato soup recipe I use half and half for, and the one time I actually 
get the fat free like the recipe suggests… sigh. My hubby decided this 
cake was what he wanted for father’s day.</p>

				<p>Diane — I am not sure because I don’t know how smoothly it will 
stir into chocolate, without having tried it in ganache. Maybe try just a
 fraction of the recipe first, so if it’s not good, you don’t ruin too 
much of the chocolate.</p>

				<p>Hi Deb, just thought I’d chime because I made it as sheet cake, 
contrary your advice. I doubled the recipe and made two  11×15 layers 
(for ~40 people). Freezing the layers was a great tip and helped a lot. I
 doubled the frosting, was just barely enough (but halved the sugar in 
it) and tripled the glaze, it was just perfect. Thanks for the great 
recipes on here!</p>

				<p>I realize I am 6 years late to the party, but this cake was 
amazing.  The finished cake was one of the best looking (and best 
tasting) cakes I have made.  I’m tempted to put that ganache on 
everything.  I used regular old Hershey’s cocoa powder and it worked 
fine.  Also, the cake layers were indeed extremely soft and I think 
would have been impossible to work with without the freezing step (I had
 to freeze mine for more like 45 minutes).  Thanks for the great recipe!</p>

				<p>I am making a practice wedding cake with this recipe. My cakes 
collapsed! The 8in versions dropped about half an inch, while the 6in 
layer dropped a full inch in the middle. Could I have over beaten it? Or
 was my baking odds old? Any advice in what to tweak next time?</p>

				<p>Drea — You didn’t use flour that already had leavener in it, did 
you? Usually sinking is from too much or too little baking soda/baking

canola or vegetable oil?  I don’t keep the latter in my pantry for

				<p>Made 2/3 of the recipe for a two-layer 8 inch cake. Best cake 
ever. Cake was soft, fluffy and rich. The savouy PB frosting (reduced 
sugar) balances the richness of the cake and makes one want to have 
another slice. Thanks for sharing!</p>

				<p>Thoughts on whether I could travel 5 hours by car with this cake?
  I could keep it refrigerated up until I leave and put ice packs up 
against the box (I have a plastic cake carrier so could wrap a few ice 
packs around the outside).  I could then refrigerate it as soon as I get
 to my destination for a bit before letting it come to room temp again a
 few hours later to eat?  Is that overly optimistic with the cream 
cheese?</p>

 in, not a problem. No cream cheese is going to go bad that quickly,

				<p>Hi Deb!!  I can’t wait to try this one but I know I’ll LOVE it!!!
 I’ve loved every single recipe I’ve tried. I have a technical question.
 After I try a recipe, I love going back to website/blog to copy and 
paste it into Word so I can save it to my computer.  Yours is the only 
site that pastes into Word in a weird format. I can only print directly 
from you but not save.  Is there a secret to saving recipes?  Often 
people ask for the recipe and I can print it out (with any of my 
creative changes), and give it to them!!!</p>

				<p>Fredda — You might try highlighting the recipe in full, and then 
selecting Clear All Formatting (in the last version of Word on my 
computer, they’ve confusingly moved this to under the Edit tab &gt; 
Clear &gt; Clear Formatting) to remove any messes. That said, we are in 
the midst of a redesign (and also, recoding every recipe on this site) 
and when it’s done, all of these process should be much easier. One more
 option would be to go to the Print template for each recipe, which is 
pared down in formatting, and copying and pasting from there. Hope that 
helps.</p>

				<p>I made this in 2 9″ pans, it turned out just fine. I used 
Hershey’s Special Dark, which yielded a dark, intense but not overly 
sweet cake and brewed strong coffee instead of straight water. Reduced 
the sugar in the frosting (to about 2.5/3 cups) and really liked the 
flavor, taste as you go, end on what tastes “!”. Only alterations. I 
used Giherdelli semi sweet for the ganache, won’t do that again. To me 
the chips have an alcohol smell to them while in the bag. In other items
 (chocolate chip cookies) I can’t report a smell.</p>
<p>One layer (halved and stacked) went to a dinner party, results were 
mixed (too rich – incredible – clean plate, no comment), took the other 
to a party and got great reviews. People just sat and took slivers every
 so often, very flattering.</p>
<p>Really good cake, flavorful not overly sweet and great frosting. Ganache is good, use chocolate you like! (duh!)</p>

				<p>This is the best and most impressive cake I have ever made.  I 
served it Christmas Day for my daughter’s 26th birthday brunch.  I was 
surprised how thin the cake batter was.  The cake was incredibly moist. 
 I agree, the cake serves many more than 12-16 since it is so rich and 
delicious.  Ther frosting is incredible and such a great color contrast 
to the dark cake.  Who can resist the chocolate ganache.  No decisions 
needed for her 27th birthday cake, it will be this cake again!</p>

				<p>I’ve made this twice in the last week. First as a cake, reducing 
frosting sugar to 3.75 cups. Then again as cupcakes with same sugar 
reduction in frosting. Both keep very well. I got 36 cupcakes with a ton
 of frosting each and extra ganache (no complaints here). Cupcakes took 
20 min to bake. Highly recommended!</p>

				<p>I made a version of this cake for my engagement party and it was 
divine.  I made 1 1/2 times the recipe of Cooks’ Illustrated chocolate 
layer cake, Martha Stewart’s caramel with my own additions of lemon 
juice and vanilla, and this peanut butter icing mixed with a double of 
Cooks’ Illustrated’s peanut butter icing that was a simple peanut butter
 buttercream without cream cheese.  I divided it into 2 10-inch pans to 
make 4 layers, and the cake fed 50 people.  I’m still getting 
compliments, and my dad wouldn’t even let me take home the last piece of
 cake because he wanted it for breakfast.  If you’re torting the layers,
 a frozen cake is your best friend.  It split easily, and the caramel 
set up very quickly so I didn’t have to worry about a mess.  It also 
crumb coated beautifully.</p>

				<p>Thank you for sharing this recipe!   I made this cake for my 
nephew’s 24th birthday and it came out perfectly.  Structurally sound 
and delicious! (I always struggle with the 3 layer cake…but not this 
time.)  My advice: Do Not skip the  freezer/refrigerator directions!  It
 made frosting a breeze!  </p>
<p>The chocolate cake is so moist and just the perfect amount of 
chocolate, the peanut butter frosting will have you sneaking spoonfuls 
from the mixing bowl and  the glaze is playfully sophisticated: serve 
this at a tea or a children’s party .  I wish I could share a photo –  
teacher it looks just like yours!  :)</p>

				<p>this cake is a PERFECT make-ahead cake! i made the cake layers on
 a sunday and froze them, then the frosting and ganache on a wednesday 
night and frosted. we didn’t serve the cake until friday night and it 
was divine. it still is, one week later. it keeps so well in the fridge.
 i like it softened, after about 30 min or so. the boyfriend, whose 
birthday cake it is, likes it both right out of the fridge and softened.
 </p>
<p>the cake itself is so chewy and moist — not at all dry or crumbly. </p>
<p>the ganache did not work well for me, it melted weird and didn’t 
drizzle, but i just spread it on and it’s lovely and delicious. i would 
totally make this cake again.</p>

				<p>Well, I finally slayed the beast. Made the cakes in two layers, 
froze them overnight and also made and chilled the frosting overnight 
too. Thawed cakes next morning, slathered in frosting (no crumb coat, so
 it as a bit messy) and then made ganache. Tasted as good as I had 
always hoped it would. So thrilled I finally did it! This was my first

				<p>I made this cake for my brother’s birthday, and the entire family
 loved it. The cake itself was super moist–so good! I added a bit more 
peanut butter to the frosting (I love the stuff), but I had to forget 
about the ganache. As much as I’m sure it’s even better with that extra 
chocolate, this cake is definitely still great without. </p>
<p>Also, I have some family members who don’t like peanut butter, and 
they still had seconds of this cake. I think that if you like peanut 
butter, you can taste it, but it’s subtle enough that most people will 
enjoy it.</p>
<p>A real winner!</p>

				<p>I made this cake, i had a real ‘bee in my bonnet’ about it, and 
my family said oh just make it already. So I did. We ate it in two 
sittings, it was as good as it looked. My neighbor has a son who is 
allergic to peanuts, so she never has peanut butter in the house. I had 
her over, gave her a big old piece  and she loved it! We all agreed we 
won’t do this again too soon, but oh my, it was good. I did the freeze 
thing, actually all I had to do was stick them outside because its so 
darn cold here upstate, and it worked perfectly. Looked just like the 
pics. It was a little challenging to slice, but we ate all of it!</p>

 and then cut in half to form two layers, but am unsure of ingredient

				<p>This is a truly fantastic cake. I’ve made it twice, once with the
 normal recipe as written, and the second in a gluten-free version. Both
 were fantastic. For the GF adaptation, sub the flour with 280 grams 
sorghum blend (35% sorghum, 35% potato starch, 30% tapioca starch). Use 
non-Dutch process cocoa, as this works better in GF recipes (I used just
 regular Frye’s). When you add the water, start with just a cup and see 
if you need any more, because the first time I did it, the whole amount 
made the batter way too thin. I ended up using about 1 cup, 1 Tbsp the 
second time around. I also baked it in two 9-inch round pans, which 
baked for about 30 min each, and still produced a nice, high cake.</p>

				<p>So my husband is also a HUGE chocolate P.B. freak, but really 
what sane person isn’t.  I want to make him this cake for his birthday 
and both of us really prefer dark chocolate to milk chocolate, would it 
be ok to switch the milk for dark in the ganache?  I was afraid it might
 make it too rich since you said it was already a pretty heavy cake.</p>

				<p>I made this yesterday for my husband’s birthday, and it was a 
hit! It was by far the best cake I have ever baked. The chocolate cake 
base will now be my go-to recipe.  The frosting and ganache were also 
easy and delicious. I only needed to serve 4 adults and 1 toddler, so I 
cut the recipe in half and baked three 6-inch layers at 325 for about 27
 minutes. We still have half the cake left, so I’m off to have a piece 
for breakfast. :D</p>

				<p>I have made this cake and variations several times, and it is 
always delicious: thank you! Last week I messed up the ingredients for 
the crust of a pretzel strawberry jelly (in the British sense of the 
word) dish and ended up doubling the crust, and put the extra in a 
springform for later use. I just filled it with a no-bake cheesecake 
meets this peanut butter frosting (1/2 c pow sugar instead of 5 and 1 
cup of whipped heavy cream along w the p.b. &amp; crime cheese) filling 
and topped it with this ganache and topped with salted peanuts. We are 
calling it peanut butter-chocolate pretzel pie, and I have zero 
hesitation recommending it.</p>

				<p>I am sharing my misadventure so others may learn from my mistake.
 I wanted to make a half recipe, but I wanted it nice and tall, so I 
thought I could bake a half recipe of the batter in a 9×13 pan, cut the 
sheet into quarters and stack them. If it had been brownie layers it 
might have worked. But with this super soft cake, and the hot night 
making the frosting greasy… LOL, it was NOT happening. I got them 
stacked, I’d got them more or less frosted (the frosting is very 
delicious btw), I’d glopped the glaze on top… and it was leaning tower 
of Pisa time. My husband ran in to brace the toppling cake while I 
quickly lined a 9inch square pan with parchment; we tumbled the pieces 
into the pan, and I have squished them down into it and have stuck it 
all in the freezer. My fond hope is that it will emerge as a sort of 
frozen peanut butter chocolate trifle and that I will be able to serve 
thin marbled slices. I’ll let you know.</p>

				<p>Ok, not that anyone was necessarily waiting with bated breath, 
but: this cake is ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC broken up, squished tightly into a
 pan, frozen and unmolded as a sort of, like, cake terrine. It formed 
gorgeous striations of cake and filling and fudge, and the cold enhanced
 the textures of all of them. My kid has asked for this version as her 
birthday cake this year.</p>

				<p>Hi!!  I’ve made this cake twice.  The first time (I am a novice 
baker) was a fail because I tried to rush and cut corners.  The second 
time I did it the right way and it turned out beautifully!!  I received 
so many compliments on it that the chocolate cake recipe has become my 
go-to chocolate cake recipe with variations of frostings.  I LOVE IT!!<br>
My question is, Deb, is it possible to adjust the recipe for cupcakes 
(still novice and learning)?  I have a party of around 25-30 people I 
need to accommodate and I  was thinking  cupcakes might serve them 
better.  Any thoughts?</p>

				<p>Jocelyn — Yes to cupcakes. Dozens of commenters mention having 
done so with success, see comments #230, 233, 343, 430, 1139, 1151, 1164

				<p>Just wanted to let you know this cake is living on. I made it for
 the fourth or fifth time last night and it was delicious as always. 
Thank you!</p>
