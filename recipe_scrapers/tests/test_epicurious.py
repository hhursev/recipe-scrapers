Crack eggs one at a time and place over sauce, spacing evenly apart. Transfer skillet to oven and bake until whites are just set but yolks are still runny, 5-8 minutes. Garnish with parsley and cilantro. Serve with pita for dipping.\nPer serving: 358 calories, 22 g fat, 22 g carbohydrates\nNutritional analysis provided by Bon Appétit',
