**Test data removal**

<!-- NOTE: Please **do not** include your email address in this bugreport, as the bugreport will be public and doing so could expose your email address to spammers. -->

<!-- Please describe the test data that you would like to be removed below -->

Please could you remove the following `recipe-scrapers` test data files:

  - e.g. `test_example_scraper.testhtml`


The following statements apply to my request:

  - [ ] I am the owner of content contained within those files, and would like them to be removed.

  - [ ] I would also like them to be erased from all versions of the source control history.

<!-- NOTE: the second request may be difficult for us to fulfill; other copies of the source control exist outside of our control, and rewriting the code history makes is potentially disruptive for users and developers of this library.  however, if you require this, we may be able to accommodate your request under some circumstances -->
