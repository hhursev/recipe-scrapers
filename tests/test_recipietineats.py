Not rapidly, not a slow simmer (I use medium heat on a weak stove, between medium and low on a strong stove).\nSimmer for 1.5 hours, uncovered. Stir once or twice while cooking.\nAt around 1.5 hours, when the liquid has reduced down and the pork is tender, (see Note 3 if pork is not yet tender), the fat will separate (see video).\nStir and the pork will brown and caramelise in the fat.\nOnce the liquid is all gone and it's now stuck on the pork pieces, it's ready.\nServe over rice, garnished with fresh chilli and shallots. Simple pickled vegetables are ideal for a side because the fresh acidity pairs well with the rich pork.",
