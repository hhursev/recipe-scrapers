I do not recommend preparing this as a "Keep Warm" recipe. Most slow cookers are still pretty hot when on the "Keep Warm" setting. You risk the pasta turning mushy. If you plan to let the dish sit, add your pasta at the end when the dish is done.\nAbout 10-15 minutes prior to serving, add the cheese to the cooker. Sprinkle it throughout the top.\nAllow 10-15 minutes for the cheese to melt.\nCool before serving.',
