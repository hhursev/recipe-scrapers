Next, dip into the buttermilk mixture, then dip into the flour mixture again to coat well. Repeat for remaining chicken pieces.\nPreheat about 2 inches of frying oil in a skillet or frying pan on medium to 325° F.\nAdd some of the breaded chicken breast pieces, leaving space between each. Fry for 3 to 5 minutes until browned. Rotate to brown the other sides and cook to an internal temp of at least 165° F.\nRemove the chicken breasts and place them onto a paper-towel line plate to drain. Repeat for remaining chicken pieces. Reserve some of the frying oil to make the country gravy.\nServe with country gravy or desired sauce and sides.\nTo Make the Country Gravy\nIn a medium saucepan over medium heat, stir together the reserved frying oil and flour until it forms a thick past-like consistency. If using butter, melt the butter first, then add the flour.\nSlowly add the milk while and whisk until smooth. Cook 3 to 5 minutes, stirring often, to heat and thicken the sauce.\nPour over the fried chicken and serve.",
