Press in the garlic, grate in the ginger, and stir everything together.\nCut the tempeh into cubes and add them to the marinade. Seal the container and shake well until the tempeh is completely marinated. Then let it marinate for at least 20 minutes (or overnight in the refrigerator).\nNoodles & Veggies\nMeanwhile, prepare and chop the vegetables. Cover the rice noodles with boiling water and set aside, covered, for 10 minutes (or according to package directions). Then drain and rinse with fresh water.\nCook and assemble\nOnce the tempeh is marinated, heat about 1-2 tbsp of oil in a frying pan (or wok). Remove the tempeh from the marinade (you can use the remaining marinade to make the peanut sauce) and cook until golden brown from all sides.\nAssemble the rice noodles and vegetables in bowls, as shown in the recipe video. Add the tempeh on top and drizzle with peanut sauce. Lastly, garnish with scallions, sesame seeds, and peanuts, and serve with fresh limes on the side.\nEnjoy!",
