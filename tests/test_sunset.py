Spread on a rimmed baking sheet and leave to dry at room temperature until needed (up to 2 days). For the best stuffing, the bread should be very dry.\nStep 2\n Preheat oven to 350°. Melt butter in a large frying pan over medium heat. Pour out 2 tbsp. butter and set aside.\nStep 3\n Add onion, celery, herbs, and 1/2 tsp. each salt and pepper to hot pan. Cook until onions are translucent and celery is tender-crisp, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl.\nStep 4\n Add torn bread and broth to vegetables and mix in until bread is soaked. Add salt and pepper to taste.\nStep 5\n Generously coat a 9- by 13-in. glass baking pan with 1 tsp. reserved melted butter. Pour stuffing into pan and drizzle with remaining melted butter.\nStep 6\n Cover with foil; bake 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake until starting to brown on top, about 30 minutes more.\nStep 7\nMake ahead: Up to 2 days, chilled. Reheat at 350°, covered, until hot (about 30 minutes). Remove foil and cook 10 more minutes for a crunchy top layer.\nStep 8\nVARIATIONS\nStep 9\nCrisp-Top Sourdough Stuffing with Sausage and Greens: Add 8 oz. sautéed crumbled Italian \xadsausage and 1 lb. briefly sautéed fresh spinach leaves to stuffing before baking.\nStep 10\nScandinavian Stuffing: Replace sourdough with a 1-lb. loaf of crusty rye bread, then add 1 cup chopped fresh dill and 8 oz. diced smoked pork chops to stuffing before baking.
