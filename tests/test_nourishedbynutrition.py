Remove from the heat and set aside.\nIn a bowl, combine the shredded chicken with the garlic powder, cumin, ½ cup of the salsa verde, and wilted spinach. Toss to coat.\nWrap them in a damp paper towel and microwave for 20-40 seconds to loosen them up so that they are easier to roll. You can also heat them directly the gas burner or in a saute pan one at a time. Pour ½ cup of the salsa verde on the bottom of a 9×13 baking dish, spread to coat the bottom.\nTo assemble the enchiladas, place about ¼ cup of chicken mixture on a tortilla. Gently roll the tortilla and place it seam side down into the prepared baking dish. Repeat with the remaining tortillas and chicken.\nPour the remaining 1 cup of salsa over the top of the enchiladas so they’re completely covered. Add the vegan queso blanco or shredded cheese of choice on top, if desired. Cover with foil. Bake for 25 minutes. Remove from oven and let sit for 5-10 minutes before topping with garnishes.
