2. TO COOK THE KIMCHI RICE: Spray a non-stick frying pan with oil and place over a medium-high heat. Once hot add the sliced capsicum and cook for 2-3 mins stirring occasionally to create a char. Open the bag of steamed brown rice, squeezing gently on the bag to break up any large clumps and add to the pan with the bok choy, edamame and peas and cook for 1-2 mins. Pour in the Korean seasoning and add half the kimchi, stir and cook for 1-2 mins. Season with salt to taste, remove from the pan and cover to keep warm.
3. TO COOK THE BEEF SIRLOIN: Remove the beef sirloin from its packaging and pat dry with a paper towel. Respray the pan with oil and place over a high heat. Season the beef with salt and pepper and place in the hot pan. Cook for 2-3 mins each side for medium-rare, a little longer for well done. Rest for 1-2 mins before slicing.
TO SERVE: Spoon kimchi fried rice onto plates and top with sliced beef sirloin. Dollop with sesame drizzle and sprinkle remaining kimchi and sesame sprinkle on top.""",
