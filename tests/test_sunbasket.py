Shrimp: Rinse and drain the shrimp. Pat dry on a paper-towel-lined plate. Tofu: Pat the tofu dry with paper towels; cut into ½-inch cubes. Plant-based chick*n: Pat the chick*n dry with a paper towel. In a large frying pan over medium-high heat, warm 2 to 3 teaspoons oil until hot but not smoking. Add your protein and lemongrass paste, season lightly with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally and breaking up the ground meat if using, until the protein is lightly browned and cooked through, 2 to 4 minutes for regular shrimp; 4 to 6 minutes for jumbo shrimp, tofu, or plant-based chick*n; and 5 to 7 minutes for ground meat.

Strip the mint leaves from the stems; coarsely chop or tear the leaves. In a small bowl, stir together the Thai dressing base and 1 tablespoon [2 TBL] oil; season to taste with salt and pepper. In a large bowl, combine your protein, noodles, radishes, pear, mint, kale, and 2 to 3 tablespoons Thai dressing and toss to coat (set aside the remaining dressing for serving).
