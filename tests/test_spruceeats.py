Drag a fork through the squash to separate it into spaghetti-like strands.\nWhile the squash cools, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add the broccoli and 2 tablespoons of water, cover, and cook until the broccoli is tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Wipe out the skillet.\nMelt the butter in the same skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the cream and milk, and cook until mixture is heated through and little bubbles appear near edges of the pan (do not let it come to a rolling boil).\nRemove the skillet from the heat and whisk in cheese. Season with salt and pepper.\nAdd the squash to the skillet toss to combine with the alfredo sauce.\nServe in deep bowls topped with the broccoli and parsley.",
