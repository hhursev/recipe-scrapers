    "Barbacoa",
    "Generously salt and pepper meat on all sides.",
    "In a large dutch oven (or skillet if youâ€™ll be using a slow cooker), heat oil over medium-high heat. Brown meat on all sides, in batches if necessary. This may take up to 15 minutes.",
    "Stovetop Barbacoa",
    "Add onion and just enough chicken or beef broth to mostly submerge the meat. Stir, scraping the bottom of the pan to remove any stuck-on bits. Stir in remaining ingredients and bring mixture to a low simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, until meat is very tender and can be pulled apart with a fork.",
    "Slow Cooker Barbacoa",
    "If using a slow cooker, transfer meat and any drippings remaining in the pan to the slow cooker and add onions, 1 cup of broth and remaining ingredients. Cook on high for 3 to 4 hours, low for 7 to 8 hours, until the beef is tender and can be easily shredded with a fork.",
    "Shred",
    "Once meat is done, use a slotted spoon to transfer the pieces to a cutting board. Use two forks to shred the meat, discarding any large pieces of fat as you go.",
    "Return shredded meat to the cooking liquid. Add more salt and pepper to taste.",
    "Cilantro Lime Rice",
    "Add lime juice to a 2-cup measuring cup. Fill the measuring cup the rest of the way with chicken broth.",
    "In a saucepan or rice cooker, cook rice according to package instructions, replacing the water with the lime juice/chicken broth mixture and adding butter and salt when you add the rice (if the package instructions already call for salt, do not add additional salt).",
    "After rice has finished cooking, stir in half of the lime zest and cilantro. Taste and add more lime and cilantro to taste.",
    "Burrito Bowls",
    "Divide cilantro rice between bowls or food prep containers. Top rice with shredded barbacoa and the rest of your burrito bowl toppings. Serve and enjoy."
