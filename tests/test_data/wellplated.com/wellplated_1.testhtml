<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-you-ll-love-this-fried-rice-recipe">Why You&#8217;ll Love This Fried Rice Recipe</h2>



<p>Learning how to make homemade egg fried rice&nbsp;is an easy and valuable life skill. </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>FAST</strong>. Mastering this simple technique not only yields tasty results but adds an easy, flavorful meal to your recipe arsenal that can be ready in <strong>15 minutes flat</strong>.</li>



<li><strong>Fully Loaded</strong>. Unlike the disappointing, lackluster versions of fried rice you’ve experienced in the past, this recipe doesn&#8217;t skimp on the good stuff: veggies and eggs.</li>



<li><strong>Simple, Flexible Ingredients</strong>. The ingredients to make fried rice couldn&#8217;t be easier. This simple recipe requires any vegetables you have on hand (even frozen), egg (plus any protein you like), rice (leftover rice is best), and a homemade sauce that&#8217;s just two ingredients!</li>



<li><strong>Nutritious</strong>. Fried rice can be good for you! Because you can control the sugar and oil, you can use what you need and skip what you don&#8217;t.</li>



<li><strong>Authentic Flavor</strong>. With a few easy tips (use cold rice; a bit of butter), you can make restaurant-style fried rice from scratch, no sweat.</li>



<li><strong>Leftover Friendly</strong>. Once you learn how to make it, you&#8217;ll want to go ahead and double this recipe. It’s the trifecta of sweet, sticky, and savory, and it tastes even better reheated.</li>
</ul>



<p>Ditch the takeout menu and grab your wok (or skillet). It&#8217;s time to learn how to make the best fried rice recipe!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-best-rice-for-fried-rice">The Best Rice for Fried Rice</h2>



<p>If you take one thing away from this post, let it be this: <strong>the best rice to use when making homemade fried rice is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">leftover, COLD rice</span></strong>.</p>



<ul>
<li>Cold rice works best for fried rice because it is drier, which keeps the fried rice from becoming soggy.</li>



<li>It also helps the individual rice grains separate from </li>
</ul>



<p>As far as which type of rice to use, that&#8217;s up to you! You can choose brown or white rice.</p>



<ul>
<li>For <strong>white rice</strong>, long grain rice like Jasmine rice and Basmati rice are popular (here&#8217;s <a href="https://www.wellplated.com/how-to-cook-white-rice/">How to Make White Rice Rice</a>).</li>



<li>My personal preference is<strong> brown</strong> <strong>rice</strong>. I usually use long grain because that&#8217;s what we have at home most often (Here&#8217;s <a href="https://www.wellplated.com/how-to-cook-brown-rice/">How to Cook Brown Rice</a> on the stove and <a href="https://www.wellplated.com/instant-pot-brown-rice/">Instant Pot Brown Rice</a>.</li>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-make-egg-fried-rice-from-scratch"><strong>How to Make Egg Fried Rice from Scratch</strong></h2>



<p>The magic of this recipe’s tastiness and ease lies in its fusion of fresh ingredients with pantry and freezer staples.</p>



<p>The ingredients for fried rice are simple, but they come together to create something truly addictive.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading is-style-alt" id="h-the-ingredients"><strong>The Ingredients</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Leftover COLD Rice</strong>. I cannot stress the COLD part enough, so I&#8217;m stating it here again. <strong><u>You must cool rice to make the best fried rice</u></strong>. Cold rice is the secret to great fried rice. You do cook rice before frying it, so go ahead and put the rice on the stove now. You’ll want it at the ready when it’s time to cook dinner!</li>



<li><strong>Vegetables</strong>. Unlike the takeout version, you&#8217;ll find a heap of colorful vegetables in every forkful of this fried rice recipe.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>For freshness and color, I used red bell pepper. For speed and ease, I added a 10-ounce bag of frozen peas and carrots. The carrots and peas tasted fantastic, and I spent exactly zero minutes chopping them. </li>
</ul>


<div class="block-tip title-align-left border-has-color-tertiary title-icon"><h2 class="block-tip__title"><span class="block-tip__title--wrap"><span class="block-tip__title--inner"><svg width="36" height="36" aria-hidden="true" role="img" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="#brand-swap"></use></svg>Market Swap</span></span></h2><div class="block-tip__content">

<p>You can use any mix of fresh OR FROZEN vegetables that you prefer! Here are a few other tasty veggies that work well in homemade fried rice:</p>



<ul>
<li>Pea Pods</li>



<li>Broccoli</li>



<li>Slice Onions</li>



<li>Eggplant</li>



<li>Yellow Squash </li>



<li>Zucchini</li>



<li>Mushrooms</li>



<li>Corn</li>



<li>Green beans</li>
</ul>

</div></div>


<ul>
<li><strong>Butter</strong>. Another of my best-ever fried rice secrets! Adding butter to fried rice is a pro tip that no restaurant will tell you but is oh-so-true. </li>



<li><strong>Oyster Sauce</strong>. Think of oyster sauce as an umami bomb of instant flavor. It’s thick, sticky, and its flavor is rich and complex. It coats every grain of rice with unmistakable flair. You can find oyster sauce in the Asian food aisle of any major grocery store.</li>



<li><strong>Soy Sauce</strong>. More umami. I recommend low-sodium soy sauce so that the rice doesn’t become <em>too&nbsp;</em>salty and you can better control its flavor.</li>
</ul>


<div class="block-tip title-align-left border-has-color-tertiary title-icon"><h2 class="block-tip__title"><span class="block-tip__title--wrap"><span class="block-tip__title--inner"><svg width="36" height="36" aria-hidden="true" role="img" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="#brand-note"></use></svg>Dietary Note!</span></span></h2><div class="block-tip__content">

<p>For a gluten-free fried rice recipe, swap the soy sauce for tamari or coconut aminos. I would also suggest checking the label of your oyster sauce since some brands may add gluten-containing additives.</p>

</div></div>


<ul>
<li><strong>Edamame</strong>. A quick and easy way to add protein to vegetable fried rice. Look for shelled edamame in the freezer section of the grocery store.</li>



<li><strong>Green Onions + Garlic</strong>. For freshness, bite, and zing.</li>



<li><strong>Eggs</strong>. Fried rice with egg is classic, plus it adds more protein. </li>
</ul>


<div class="block-tip title-align-left border-has-color-tertiary title-icon"><h2 class="block-tip__title"><span class="block-tip__title--wrap"><span class="block-tip__title--inner"><svg width="36" height="36" aria-hidden="true" role="img" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="#brand-substitution"></use></svg>Substitution Tip</span></span></h2><div class="block-tip__content">

<p class="has-text-align-left">For fried rice without egg, simply omit it from the recipe. If you have an egg allergy and would like something with a similar texture, try adding pieces of <a href="https://www.wellplated.com/air-fryer-tofu/">Air Fryer Tofu</a>.</p>

</div></div>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading is-style-alt" id="h-the-directions">The Directions</h3>

<li>Mix the oyster sauce and soy sauce. That good umami flavor.</li>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-recipe-variations">Recipe Variations</h2>



<p>This plain fried rice tastes anything but plain! That said, if you want to change it up, here are some ideas:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wellplated.com/chicken-fried-rice/"><strong>Chicken Fried Rice</strong></a>. You can use chicken breasts or thighs.</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://www.wellplated.com/pork-fried-rice/">Pork Fried Rice</a></strong>. Pork is another lean protein option you can try.</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://www.wellplated.com/shrimp-fried-rice/">Shrimp Fried Rice</a></strong>. Quick-cooking shrimp add virtually zero time to this recipe.</li>



<li><strong>Pineapple Fried Rice</strong>. When you add your chopped red bell pepper to the pan, also add about 2 cups of chopped fresh or drained canned pineapple. YUM!</li>



<li><strong>Low Carb Fried Rice</strong>. You can also swap out the brown rice entirely! Try this <a href="https://www.wellplated.com/healthy-fried-rice/">Cauliflower Fried Rice</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Spicy Fried Rice</strong>. Add a big pinch of red pepper flakes or top with sriracha.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-recipe-tips-and-tricks">Recipe Tips and Tricks</h2>



<ul id="block-ff176a24-33c4-4516-96af-16016e513e78">
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t Overdo the Soy Sauce</strong>. If you&#8217;re anything like I was as a kid, you loaded on the soy sauce onto your <a href="https://www.wellplated.com/stir-fry-noodles/">Stir Fry Noodles</a> until it was swimming in a pool. While it may be tempting to keep adding more soy sauce while cooking, stick to the 1 tablespoon (I promise it will have plenty of flavor). You can always add a drizzle on your portion later.</li>



<li><strong>Use a Large Pan or Wok</strong>. Make sure your pan is big enough to cook all the ingredients evenly and stir easily without spills. Nothing worse than losing some of this precious dish off the side of the pan!</li>



<li><strong>Keep Your Pan HOT</strong>. A hot pan is critical for achieving that crispy, toasty deliciousness that comes from perfect fried rice. If your pan isn&#8217;t hot enough, you may end up steaming everything instead of frying it.</li>



<li><strong>Do Not Stir the Eggs until They&#8217;ve Started to Set</strong>. Use a rubber spatula to break the eggs into little, bite-sized pieces. Take care not to overcook!</li>



<li><strong>Chop the Veggies Small</strong>. Whichever vegetables you choose, to make this recipe move quickly and ensure the vegetables cook evenly, chop the vegetables small. (Also true for <a href="https://www.wellplated.com/cabbage-stir-fry/">Cabbage Stir Fry</a>.)</li>



<li><strong>Load on the Veggies</strong>. Unlike the takeout version, this homemade fried rice can be hearty enough to stand on its own without a separate main dish. Toss in whatever veggies you and your family love, and this dish will become colorful, flavorful, and filling!</li>



<li><strong>USE COLD RICE</strong>. If it feels like I&#8217;m obsessing over this point, it&#8217;s because I am. This is how you can make fried rice better. (Save the freshly-cooked rice for <a href="https://www.wellplated.com/broccoli-rice-casserole/">Broccoli Rice Casserole</a>.)</li>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-storage-tips">Storage Tips</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>To Store</strong>. Let your cooked homemade fried rice cool to room temperature, then place it in the fridge in an airtight storage container for up to 5 days.</li>



<li><strong>To Reheat</strong>. Gently rewarm leftovers in a large skillet over medium-low heat until hot. You can also place leftovers on a microwave-safe plate or in a bowl and microwave for 1 minute or until warmed through.</li>



<li><strong>To Freeze</strong>. Once your homemade fried rice has cooled, place it in an airtight, freezer-safe storage container or zip-top bag, removing as much air as possible. Freeze for up to 3 months. Let thaw overnight in the refrigerator, then reheat as directed.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-to-serve-with-egg-fried-rice">What to Serve with Egg Fried Rice</h2>



<p>Thanks to the heap of vegetables, edamame, egg, and whole grains, this recipe is substantial and well-rounded enough to be relatively good for you as a main dish too.</p>



<p>That said, if you&#8217;d like to serve it as a side or part of a larger meal, here are some ideas:</p>



<ul id="block-15bb541a-9cf4-497b-b3fa-e40f6f6bb34b">
<li><strong>Chicken</strong>. Chicken is the perfect complement to a side of homemade fried rice! Try serving it with <a href="https://www.wellplated.com/slow-cooker-honey-garlic-chicken/">Slow Cooker Honey Garlic Chicken</a> or <a href="https://www.wellplated.com/sweet-and-sour-chicken/">Sweet and Sour Chicken</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Salmon</strong>. Elevate your homemade fried rice by pairing it with <a href="https://www.wellplated.com/soy-ginger-salmon/">Soy Ginger Salmon</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Beef</strong>. Tasty <a href="https://www.wellplated.com/slow-cooker-beef-and-broccoli/">Crockpot Beef and Broccoli</a> would be a wonderful main dish to serve with your homemade fried rice.</li>



<li><strong>Tofu</strong>. For a delicious option, serve your fried rice recipe with <a href="https://www.wellplated.com/tofu-stir-fry/">Tofu Stir Fry</a> or <a href="https://www.wellplated.com/air-fryer-tofu/">Air Fryer Tofu</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Lettuce Wraps</strong>. For a light main dish, serve this homemade fried rice with <a href="https://www.wellplated.com/asian-lettuce-wraps/">Asian Lettuce Wraps</a> or <a href="https://www.wellplated.com/vegetarian-lettuce-wraps/">Vegetarian Lettuce Wraps</a>. Or wrap the rice right inside of a bibb lettuce leave and use it as a filling.</li>



<li><strong>Asian-Inspired Veggies</strong>. Try <a href="https://www.wellplated.com/asian-cabbage-salad/">Asian Cabbage Salad</a> or <a href="https://www.wellplated.com/asian-cucumber-salad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Asian Cucumber Salad</a>.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-recommended-tools-to-make-this-recipe">Recommended Tools to Make this Recipe</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/3Mwd4dg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wok</a></strong>. If you love making stir fry recipes, adding a wok to your kitchen cookware collection is well worth the investment.</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/3CZP1jG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Chopsticks</a></strong>. Adding a pair of fun and fancy chopsticks takes takeout-style meals at home to the next level (I also love these are dishwasher safe).</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/3TrnGwt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Glass Measuring Cup</a></strong>. For whisking together that yummy, simple fried rice sauce.</li>
</ul>



<p>I often lovingly refer to this sort of <a href="https://www.wellplated.com/category/recipes-by-cuisine/asian/">Asian cuisine-inspired recipe</a> as “takeout, fake out” but the nickname doesn’t feel appropriate this time.</p>



<p>Honestly, this egg fried rice is so delicious, standard takeout fried rice or hibachi fried rice will never do it for you again!</p>

<li><strong>TO STORE</strong>: Let your cooked homemade fried rice come to room temperature and place it in the refrigerator in an airtight storage container for up to 5 days.</li>
<li><strong>TO REHEAT</strong>: Place your fried rice on a microwave-safe plate or in a bowl and microwave for 1 minute or until warmed through.</li>
<li><b>TO FREEZE</b>: Once your homemade fried rice has cooled, place it in a freezer-safe container or ziptop bag, removing as much air as possible. Freeze for up to 3 months.</li>
<li><strong>*INGREDIENT</strong> <strong>NOTE</strong>: Oyster sauce is readily available in the Asian or international food aisle of most major grocery stores. It has a unique flavor and texture, and if you substitute something else for it, your fried rice won&#8217;t taste the same. If you&#8217;d like to experiment with making the recipe without oyster sauce, you can simply omit it or swap in 1 tablespoon of sesame oil to add flavor. </li>

<div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1629842957205"><strong class="schema-faq-question">C<strong>an You Make Fried Rice With Fresh Rice</strong>?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">You <em>can</em> make fried rice with fresh rice, but let the rice chill completely in the refrigerator before starting the recipe. This is <strong>CRUCIAL</strong> for the recipe to turn out properly. For best results, stick to day-old rice (or rice that&#8217;s been in the freezer and then thawed).</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1664570338415"><strong class="schema-faq-question">What Makes Chinese Fried Rice Taste So Good?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Takeout fried rice is typically loaded with unhealthy fats and sodium and sugar-heavy sauces. While these DO taste divine, they&#8217;re not the healthiest option to eat on the regular. I think this healthy fried rice gives you the best of both worlds.</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1664570608238"><strong class="schema-faq-question">Can Fried Rice Be Eaten Cold?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Truth be told, I love this dish leftover just as much as I do when it&#8217;s fresh. The flavors marry, and it becomes <strong>extra</strong> irresistible. And, yes, I’ve been known to eat it cold right out of the container (sometimes at breakfast with cold <a href="https://www.wellplated.com/beef-lo-mein/">Beef Lo Mein</a>).</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1686006096460"><strong class="schema-faq-question">Does Mixing Egg Into Rice Cook It?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">As long as you heat and stir the eggs over high heat for a few minutes, they will cook. While I prefer to cook the eggs before frying the rice, then add them in at the end so you get those tasty bits of egg, if you forget to cook the eggs first, you can pour beaten eggs into the rice at the end, then stir to cook them through. </p> </div> </div>

					<p>The peppers do not belong in fried rice.   The peppers are too strong and that is the only thing you taste.  My rice was not fluffy as the vegetables had too much water I think.  It all stuck together and was very glue like.  I will not be making again.</p>
