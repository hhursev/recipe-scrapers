    "Preheat the oven to 350° Fahrenheit. Place a small pan filled with 1 inch of water at the bottom of the oven to create a water bath. Grease the bottom and sides of the springform pan generously with melted butter or cooking spray. Wrap the bottom of the pan with aluminum foil to prevent leaking.",
    "In a small bowl mix the crushed oreo crumbs, 1/4 cup of white sugar, and melted butter to make the oreo crust. Line the bottom of the cheesecake pan with the cookie crumble. Press down with your fingers so that it is packed firm. You can also press some of the crust up the sides of the pan.",
    "Use an electric hand mixer or stand mixer to beat the sugar and softened cream cheese on medium speed until smooth, about 60-90 seconds.",
    "Add the peppermint extract, melted white chocolate chips and 4 tablespoons of the creme de menthe. Beat on medium speed until smooth, about 60 seconds. Taste, and add the remaining 1 or 2 tablespoons of creme de menthe if desired. (see notes if not using the creme de menthe liqueur)",
    "Add the eggs and beat on low until they are just incorporated, about 20 seconds. Be careful not to overmix or mix on a higher speed, as this could put too much air into the cake.",
    "Pour the filling into the springform pan and put into the oven uncovered. Bake until the center no longer wiggles, approximately 60-75 minutes. When done, turn off the oven and crack open the door. Keep the cheesecake in the oven until it comes to room temperature, about 1 hour.",
    "Transfer cheesecake to the counter and open the side of the pan carefully. Cover with plastic wrap. Allow to chill in the fridge for at least 4 hours (preferably overnight) before adding your toppings and serving."
