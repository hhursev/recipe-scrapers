  "description": "It doesn’t happen very often in my house that I have any leftover or stale tortilla chips, but if you do…chicken tortilla soup is a great way to use them up. If you don't have leftover tortilla chips, this is still a great soup to make. In fact, it's even better to serve with some chips, salsa, guacamole and other toppings along side.",
