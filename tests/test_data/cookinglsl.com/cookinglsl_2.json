    "For the chocolate sponge cake:",
    "Preheat oven to 400F. Spray a jelly roll pan (9x13-inch) with cooking spray, line with parchment paper and spray with cooking spray over the paper.",
    "In the bowl of a stand mixer, fitted with he paddle attachment, beat the egg yolks and sugar for 4-5 minutes on high speed, until pale and frothy. Add vanilla.",
    "In a bowl combine flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt. Add to the egg yolks mixture, beat until combined. The mixture will be thick.",
    "Beat egg whites until soft peaks form. Add 1/3 of the egg whites to the egg yolks flour mixture and stir to incorporate. This will thin the mixture. Then fold in the remaining egg whites.",
    "Pour batter into the prepared pan, smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 8-11 minutes, the cake is set and spongy to the touch. Take out of the oven immediately.",
    "Flip roll onto a kitchen towel dusted generously with powdered sugar. Roll into a log. Let it cool completely.",

    "Beat mascarpone with powdered sugar and cocoa powder for 2 minutes on medium speed. Slowly add the vanilla extract and heavy cream, beating on medium. Turn the speed to medium-high and beat for 2-3 more minutes, until thick and fluffy. Do not over mix. Add the International Delight® Peppermint Mocha Coffee Creamer and mix until just incorporated. Use immediately.",
    "For the chocolate ganache:",
    "Heat heavy cream in a small saucepan. Place the chocolate in a bowl. Pour hot heavy cream on top. Let it stand for 1 minute, then stir until smooth. Let it cool a little and pour over the cake roll.",
    "To assemble:",
    "When the roll is cool, carefully unroll. Spread generous amount of filling over it (the filling that this recipe makes might be more than needed). Roll the cake again. Place on a wire rack and pour the ganache on top. Sprinkle with holiday sprinkles on top. Refrigerate for 1 hour, until set.",
    "Slice and enjoy!"
