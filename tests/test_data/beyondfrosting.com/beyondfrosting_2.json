  "instructions_list": [
    "For the Crust:",
    "Prepare a 9-inch springform pan by lightly greasing the edges of the pan with cooking spray, and then wiping gently with a paper towel.",
    "Grind the graham crackers into a fine crumb using a food processor or blender. Combine the melted butter and graham cracker crumbs, stirring until well combined.",
    "Pour the crumbs into the springform pan and press firmly into the bottom and up on the sides of the pan to create the crust. Refrigerate the crust while preparing the filling.",
    "For the Filling:",
    "Wash and hull the strawberries. Puree them in a food processor or blender until smooth, yielding about 1¾ cups of puree.",
    "Transfer the puree to a medium-sized saucepan. Heat over medium to medium-low heat, stirring as needed to prevent burning and sticking, until the mixture reduces to about ½ cup. This can take up to 30 minutes. Allow the mixture to cool completely. Refrigerate to speed up the cooling process.",
    "Chop the white chocolate bar into smaller pieces. Microwave at 50% power in 30-second increments, stirring each time until the chocolate is melted. Stir until completely smooth. Set aside to cool.",
    "Prepare the whipped cream. Chill the mixing bowl and beater blade for 5-10 minutes in the freezer or refrigerator. Beat the heavy cream in the chilled bowl and using the whisk attachment and beat at a high speed until the cream thickens to soft peaks. Add the powdered sugar and continue beating on high speed until stiff peaks form. If needed, transfer to a separate bowl and set aside.",
    "Next beat the cream cheese until it’s completely smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add the granulated sugar and vanilla extract and continue beating until smooth. Then add the melted chocolate and strawberry puree, beating until combined.",
    "Finally, slowly fold in the whipped cream until it’s completely smooth. Pour the filling into the prepared cooled crust, spreading evenly. Refrigerate for 3-4 hours until it’s firm.",
    "For the Topping:",
    "Prepare another batch of whipped cream following the instructions above. Use a large piping bag to pipe the borders of the cheesecake. Garnish with fresh fruit."
