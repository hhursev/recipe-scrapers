<p><span style="color: #000000;">Vietnamese Pho is a beautifully fragrant and healthy noodle soup. Pho can be made using any kind of protein, the most popular being beef pho, but our favorite is Chicken Pho. Chicken Pho is much easier to make and the broth is much lighter than beef. Lending a more subtle flavor, while being extra nourishing! </span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Let&rsquo;s chat about our favorite two shortcuts to make this incredible noodle soup. </strong></span></h2>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Use whatever bone-in chicken is on sale at your grocery store or has been hiding in the back of your freezer. </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Use an electric pressure cooker! This has become a very common appliance in many kitchens, but if you don&rsquo;t have one, be sure to put it on your holiday list!&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shortcuts don&rsquo;t equal less flavor, they just equal less time making dinner. We use these shortcuts because they make dinner time easier without sacrificing zero flavor and will have a meal in a fraction of the time! </span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>What spices do we need for Chicken Pho?&nbsp;<br>
</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Spices are a quintessential part of this Vietnamese Chicken Pho. They create tons of flavor by just simply being saut&eacute;d and hanging out in the broth. These spices will infuse your Pho broth and contribute to that rich and decadent flavor broth.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Ginger</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Garlic&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Coriander Seeds&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Star Anise&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Cloves (optional)&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Fish Sauce &ndash; fish sauce with only 2 ingredients, anchovy and salt is best!&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Steps to Create Chicken Pho&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">With these four quick and easy steps you will have the most flavorful Vietnamese Chicken Pho on your table in less than one hour! </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Saut&eacute; your onions, ginger, garlic, and spices together until lightly caramelized and fragrant.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Add your bone-in chicken, cover with water, and cook for 20 minutes on high pressure. While your broth is cooking, cook your rice noodles.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Remove chicken from the broth and shred once cool enough to handle.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Drain spices from the broth and add the broth back to the pot.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Divide noodles and chicken among your bowls and customize with your favorite toppings!&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Assembly and Customization of your Chicken Pho&nbsp;<br>
</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We love a customizable bowl over here at Steamy Kitchen! This is a great meal for all because you can make it totally your own. Don&rsquo;t love one of the toppings or something too spicy? Leave it out! Love extra herbs and bean sprouts and want to shout it from the roof tops? Go nuts! So line up your table with all of the fixings and create your own. We love a good BYOB (Build Your Own Bowl!)&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Thinly sliced onion, soaked in water &ndash; this tones down the raw onion bite&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Fresh herbs: Our non negotiables are Thai or regular basil, cilantro, and green onion. Mint is a nice addition but totally optional!&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Sliced jalape&ntilde;o &ndash; For the spice lovers in your life!&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Bean sprouts &ndash; Can&rsquo;t beat the crunch and freshness of added bean sprouts!&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">Lime &ndash; Acidity is crucial for your Chicken Pho and will always bring out the flavors of your dish even more.&nbsp;</span></li>
