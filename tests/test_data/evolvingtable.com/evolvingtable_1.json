      "reviewBody": "This was one of the best meals I've had ever!  Thank you for this.  \r\n\r\nYour heat scale for using the Sriracha sauce was spot on.  I used a Tablespoon and it was mildly spicy and just perfect for me!  I added an extra squeeze of honey on the salmon for extra sweetness.  It was PERFECTION!\r\n\r\nI do have a question though.  I believe I followed your instructions but did not have ANY marinade left over to put in the pan with the salmon.  Am wondering how much you typically have left over to pour back in there and then cook down when you make it?"
