  "title": "Pie Crust Recipe",
  "ingredients": [
    "1⅓ cups (6 ½ oz/185 g) all-purpose flour",
    "1 tablespoon powdered sugar",
    "⅛ teaspoon salt",
    "7 tablespoons (3 ½ oz/100 g) butter (, cold and cubed)",
    "1 large egg yolk*",
    "2 - 3 tablespoons water (, cold)"
  ],
  "instructions_list": [
    "In a large bowl add the flour, powdered sugar and salt and mix together.",
    "Add the butter and rub in with your fingers until it resembles coarse breadcrumbs. (You can also do this in the food processor).",
    "In a small bowl, mix together the egg yolk and 2 tablespoons of water and add to the dry ingredients.",
    "Mix gently until your dough comes together. Then, using your hands, pull the dough together to incorporate any dry pieces. If your dough seems too dry, you can add some of your remaining water. (Be careful not to hastily add more liquid as this will not yield the best results).",
    "Wrap the pastry in cling wrap and refrigerate for a minimum of 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax before rolling. (The dough will get a little wetter once it relaxes).",
    "Bake according to your recipe directions. Or store for up to 2 days in the fridge. (You can also freeze the dough for up to 8 weeks and defrost overnight in the fridge before using)."
