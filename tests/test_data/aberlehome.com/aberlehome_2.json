    "240g whole wheat einkorn flour",
    "2 teaspoons baking powder (see notes for high altitude adjustment)",
    "1/2 teaspoon baking soda",
    "1/4 teaspoon + 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt",
    "3/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg (decrease if using freshly-ground)",
    "120g granulated sugar",
    "6 Tablespoons salted butter, melted and slightly cooled",
    "2 large eggs",
    "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract",
    "100g sourdough starter (ripe or discard), 100% hydration",

    "1 Tablespoon salted butter, melted and slightly cooled",
    "3 Tablespoons granulated sugar",

  "instructions_list": [
    "Preheat oven to 425°F. Line a standard muffin pan with paper liners.",
    "Prepare dry ingredients: In a medium-size bowl, whisk together einkorn flour with baking powder, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg until thoroughly combined. Set aside.",
    "Mix: In a large bowl, add granulated sugar, melted butter, eggs, and vanilla extract. Beat with a whisk or an electric hand mixer on medium speed until combined. Beat in sourdough starter and sour cream, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add reserved dry ingredients. Mix on low speed until combined.",
    "Scoop the batter evenly into the 12 wells of the prepared muffin pan using a large scoop or a small measuring cup.",
    "Bake: Bake on the center rack for 5 minutes at 425°F, then without opening the oven door, lower the oven temperature to 375°F and bake for an additional 10-12 minutes until a toothpick inserted in the center of the muffins comes out clean.",
    "Cinnamon-sugar topping: Allow muffins to cool in the pan for 10 minutes. While the muffins are cooling, melt the butter for the topping and stir together the granulated sugar and cinnamon-sugar in a small bowl.",
    "Transfer muffins from the pan to a wire rack. Brush the top of the first muffin with melted butter using a pastry brush (an even, thin layer works the best) and then immediately invert the muffin into the cinnamon-sugar mixture to coat. Repeat with the remaining muffins, then serve."
