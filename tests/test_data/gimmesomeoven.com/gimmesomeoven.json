And the hard alcohol was spiced rum! I didn‚Äôt have any fizzy options to use tonight but I plan on trying a dry hard apple cider tomorrow (after I buy some)."

      "reviewBody": "Loved it!  Made the simple syrup, but it wasn‚Äôt really needed, given the wine I used for the sangria.  Did 1/3 cup of cognac (what I had on hand) instead of the 1/2 cup of brandy.  Used oranges, peaches, and strawberries.  It was yummy.  The cinnamon stick definitely added a light spice flavor to the sangria. We munched on the fruit after all the liquid was gone."
