  "title": "Basic + Awesome Broccoli Cheese Soup",
  "ingredients": [
    "5 tablespoons butter, divided",
    "1 small onion, minced",
    "3 cloves garlic, minced",
    "1 cup broccoli stems, chopped (optional)",
    "1/4 cup all-purpose flour",
    "1 cup whole milk",
    "1 cup half and half",
    "2 1/2 cups chicken or vegetable broth",
    "2-3 cups broccoli florets, chopped into very small pieces",
    "1 large carrot, thinly sliced",
    "1 teaspoon salt (more or less to taste)",
    "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper",
    "1/2 teaspoon paprika",
    "an 8-ounce block of good quality extra-sharp cheddar cheese, grated"
  ],
  "instructions_list": [
    "SautÃ© garlic and onion",
    "In a large soup pot or Dutch oven, melt 1 tablespoon butter over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, and broccoli stems; sautÃ© until soft and fragrant, about 5 minutes.",
    "Build your roux",
    "Add remaining 4 tablespoons butter to the soup pot. When butter is melted, add flour to the pot. Cook over medium heat for about 2-3 minutes, until flour is thickened. Slowly pour in the milk and half and half, whisking constantly. (It will start thick but eventually it will thin out and resemble a creamy soup base.) Continue to thin it out, gradually whisking in the broth. Simmer for 10 minutes or so, whisking occasionally to reincorporate the skin that may form.",
    "Add broccoli",
    "When the soup base is thickened nicely, stir in the broccoli, carrots, and spices. Simmer for 10 minutes or so, until the broccoli bits are bright green and fork-tender.",
    "Add cheese",
    "Transfer the pot off of heat and allow to cool slightly for a few minutes. Stir in most of the cheese until melted. Serve in bowls with a little extra cheese + a hunk of crusty bread for dunking â€“ and yes, itâ€™s okay to cry tears of cozy joy! This is a happy moment!"

Usually I thank the Lord for who invented the \"jump to recipe\" button before pressing it, but I don't feel the compulsion to do that with your blogs. Thanks for sharing your fun personality through your food &amp; writing...keep it up! Definitely looking forward to trying this creamy, cheesy delight! Come on Fall!"

It's 10 AM, and now I'm trying to use my patience to wait until lunch time to eat a full bowl. I've been stealing spoonfuls for the past 30 minutes. It's so so so so so so good! Thank you for this recipe!!"
