  "description": "One of my all-time favorite German dishes is sauerbraten, but I don't love that it normally takes five to 10 days to make. Using an electric pressure cooker, I think I've captured that same distinctive flavor in less than two hours. —James Schend, Dairy Freed",

      "reviewBody": "That is NOT German Sauerbraten at all! Not even near to it! Sauerbraten is cooked in one piece and has a sauce. ;-/ It is served with Klössen or potatoes. Never ever with noodles or carrots."

      "reviewBody": "I like this recipe. My late MIL would brine the meat for 2-3 days when she made sauerbraten from scratch. This recipe is easy and my husband appreciates that the flavor is not vinegar forward. I made this last night and used rump roast because I could not find top round. If I use this cut of meat again, I need to increase the time a bit to make the meat more tender. I added mushrooms this time, but it got a little lost. Love the idea of using gingersnaps as a thickener. Saw that someone used apple cider vinegar and I may try that next time."

      "reviewBody": "We're big fans of sauerbraten, and when I saw this quick method, I just had to try it.  I used my stovetop pressure cooker with no problems...cooked it under pressure the same amount of time.  It's a great recipe, and it has as much flavor as the one that takes days to make!  Instead of water, I used red wine, and I substituted apple cider vinegar for the white.  I added mustard seed and juniper berries to the spice bundle.  A keeper...!"

      "reviewBody": "I made the original recipe as written a few weeks ago. It was surprisingly delicious...however, the color wasn't a deep, dark brown as traditional sauerbraten. I had enough ingredients left that I froze the chopped vegetables in a Ziplock, the cubed beef in another Ziplock, and the crushed cookies in another! I put all three bags in a freezer bag for a quick weeknight meal. Tonight, I noticed the prior review and used apple cider vinegar and the red wine. It was perfect! Since I'm new with the Instant Pot, I cooked for 15 minutes as the meat was still frozen. I will keep the recipe as adjusted in our regular rotation."

      "reviewBody": "This is a great recipe but it would be helpful if you specified about how many people this should serve or how many servings to expect.  Also, roughly how many pounds of noodles to put in the pot as well.  I was making it for two people so I had to guess as to how many noodles to cook.  Thank you for another great recipe."

      "reviewBody": "Yum! I just got a new Instant Pot and was a bit nervous to use it. This recipe made it easy. I learned I could saute in the pot. It was absolutely amazing how the cookies thickened up the sauce. I used apple cider vinegar and it was delicious! It's a keeper recipe for me!"
