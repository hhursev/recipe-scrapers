      "reviewBody": "This was so good! I made only one 12\" pizza for two. I added more freshly chopped basil when I served it, as I didn't add enough when I topped the tomatoes. Definitely needs a lot of the basil for flavor. Maybe add some Italian seasoning the next time I make it. Used all four of the cheeses. I did make my own crust, didn't pre cook it, and baked for 20 minutes at 425 degrees. I didn't get a chance to take a picture as it was gone before I could get to it. No leftovers this week."

      "reviewBody": "I made three mini pizzas, so I had too many tomatoes but I used them for the salad. The pizzas were VERY tasty, especially with balsamic vinegar drizzled on top after baking. I even froze one uncooked in a plastic container. My son heated in air fryer and they couldn’t believe it was homemade! Will definitely make again!! The pic is before baking."

      "reviewBody": "Michelle - this was awesome! Although it only ended up being a 3 cheese pizza (no Fontina) - loved the combo of creamy and nutty! Loved the feta! While the tomatoes were marinating, pre-baked the crust a bit (based on the pre-baked brand I had) and followed instructions and cook time according to the recipe. Delicious! Only change; only add the basil for the last couple min - a few of my leaves got overly brown/toasty. While not the best cold - reheated leftovers the next day were really good! Thank you!!"

      "reviewBody": "This is one of my all-time favorite recipes. I have probably made it a hundred times or more. The only comment I have is to cut down or even eliminate the salt in the marinade - with all that cheese, it's got a lot in it already."

      "reviewBody": "WOW. My family loves this pizza. I was a little skeptical about the combination but I have a thing for gorgonzola so I gave it a try. Fantastic. Tastes like an expensive gourmet pizza. I followed the ingredient list but just put on however much I wanted. I also pre baked the crust. Thank you so much for sharing this."
