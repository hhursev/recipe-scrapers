  "instructions_list": [
    "1. Begin by making a few slices in each chicken leg - through the skin but not quite down to the bone - then set the legs aside in a large container.",
    "2. For the marinade, blend the garlic, chillies, coriander stalks, lemongrass, palm sugar, fish sauce, lime juice, soy sauce and white pepper together until smooth. Pour over the chicken legs and rub the marinade in to thoroughly cover the legs. Leave to marinate for at least 4 hours, ideally overnight.",
    "3. When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/450°F/Gas Mark 5. Place the chicken legs on a large roasting tray and place into the oven for about 1 hour, or until cooked through and golden - you can tell the chicken is cooked if you pierce the leg and the juices run clear.",
    "4. Whilst the chicken is cooking, make the nam jim dressing - place the rice into a large, dry, frying pan, ensuring it sits in one layer, so that it evenly browns, and place over a low heat. Cook, shaking and stirring frequently, until the rice begins to turn a light golden colour. Continue to cook for a further 5 - 10 minutes until the rice is a deep golden colour and smells nutty. Pour the rice into a bowl to cool then, when cool, place into a spice grinder and blend to a coarse powder.",
    "5. Measure out 1 tablespoon of the roasted rice powder and mix with the remaining ingredients for the nam jim to make the sauce.",
    "6. Cook your rice noodles according to the packet instructions and serve with the chicken alongside the prepped veggies and a sprinkling of mint leaves & the peanuts."
