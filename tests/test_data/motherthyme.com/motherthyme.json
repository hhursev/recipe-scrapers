It's very sweet, but a nice special breakfast option with fiber. :-) I made the glaze and the topping the night before and stuck them in the fridge. Then I Just had to reheat them the next morning. Made it a lot quicker on a busy weekend morning."

This has all the goey cinnamon-y, cream cheese-y flavors that I absolutely love about cinnamon rolls. I'm thinking about asking my family if they would let me make this for Christmas morning breakfast instead of our regular cinnamon rolls! 10/10!!"
