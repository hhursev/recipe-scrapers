  "title": "Rosemary Shortbread Cookies",
  "ingredients": [
    "1.75 cups all purpose flour (or whole wheat pastry flour)",
    "1/2 cup powdered sugar",
    "1 pinch sea salt",
    "the zest from 4 large lemons",
    "2 sprigs rosemary leaves (chopped- about 1 Tbsp)",
    "12 Tbsp cultured vegan butter (salted, chilled + cut into cubes)"
  ],
  "instructions_list": [
    "To the bowl of a food processor add the flour, sugar, rosemary lemon zest and salt. Process until combined.",
    "Add the butter and process using the pulse button until a dough starts to form.",
    "Transfer the cookie dough to a piece of parchment paper and using your hands form an 8 inch long log. Wrap it tightly in parchment paper and form a smooth shaped log as best you can then pop in the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes to set.",
    "Prepare a large rimmed cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. Pre-heat oven to 350”F.",
    "Take the cookie dough from the freezer and unwrap it. Slice into 16 equal slices. (At this point you can bake the cookies in slices if you don't want to stamp them).",
    "STAMPING COOKIES: Roll each slice into a ball the size of a walnut and place on the prepared cookie sheet a couple of inches apart.",
    "Take the chilled cookie stamp and dip it in flour. Press on top of each dough ball to flatten. Repeat with the rest of the cookies making sure to dip your cookie stamp in flour in between each cookie pressing to prevent any sticking. (Optional: sprinkle each cookie with a couple of sea salt flakes).",
    "FREEZE - Place stamped cookies in the freezer for the design to set for 10 minutes or so. This will help ensure the dough is firm enough and the design won't disappear on you during baking.",
    "Bake in the preheat oven for 21 to 22 minutes until lightly golden at the edges. Transfer to a cooling rack and allow to cool completely. Store in a cookie jar or lidded container at room temperature."
