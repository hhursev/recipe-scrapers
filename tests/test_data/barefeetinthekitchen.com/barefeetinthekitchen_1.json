    "2 large sweet potatoes, cut into ½\"-1\" pieces, about 4 cups",
    "2 tablespoons olive oil",
    "½ teaspoon kosher salt, adjust to taste",
    "½ teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper, adjust to taste",

    "Roasting Instructions",
    "Preheat the oven to 400°F. Place the sweet potatoes in a large mixing bowl and drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper and toss to coat thoroughly.",
    "Coat a large baking sheet with oil and spread the potatoes across it. Roast the potatoes until they are fork tender, and then roast a bit longer to get a slightly crisp edge. This usually takes between 45-70 minutes depending on how many potatoes I am cooking at the time.",
    "Skillet Instructions",
    "When the potatoes are almost done, add the sausage and the onions to a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and crumble the sausage while browning the onions.",
    "Drain the sausage (if needed) and add the spinach. Remove from the heat and toss together to wilt the spinach. Remove to a serving dish and cover loosely to keep warm.",
    "In the same skillet used for the sausage, cook the eggs until the whites are set and the yolks are still soft and runny. When ready to eat, top the spinach mixture with the soft eggs."
