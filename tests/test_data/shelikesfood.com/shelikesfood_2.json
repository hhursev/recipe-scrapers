    "Pre-heat oven to 425 degrees F. Add all of your diced vegetables to an extra large sheet pan and drizzle them with olive oil. Add garlic powder, salt and pepper (and any other seasonings you may want) and use your hands to toss everything together until vegetables are fully coated and arrange them in a single layer on the baking sheet.",
    "Place veggies in the oven and roast until fork tender and beginning to caramelize, about 30-35 minutes, flipping once. Remove from the oven and let cool for a couple of minutes.",
    "Make the tahini sauce while the vegetables are roasting. Add all sauce ingredients, except for the water, to a medium sized bowl, or jar, and mix until combined. Once the sauce gets thick, add a couple tablespoons of water at a time and mix until desired thickness is reached. You could also add in extra citrus juice instead of water, if you like.",
    "Assemble you’re bowls. To each one, add about 3/4 cup quinoa, 1/2 cup chickpeas and 1/4 of the roasted veggies. Drizzle with desired amount of dressing and add extra salt or fresh herbs, if desired."
