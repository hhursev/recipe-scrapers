<h2>Roasted Rainbow Veggie Bowl Recipe Ingredients &amp; Substitutions</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vegetables</strong> &#8211; These bowls are filled with rainbow-colored veggies, and you can use whatever kinds you like. I used a mixture of red bell pepper, butternut squash, carrot, yellow bell pepper, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, rutabaga, and red onion. I share more color options below!</li>
<li><strong>Olive Oil</strong> &#8211; I like to roast my veggies in olive oil,, but any oil can be used.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Seasonings</strong> &#8211; I go pretty simple with the seasonings, because the tahini sauce has tons of flavor. I usually just use salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Feel free to add any extra spices you like, though.</li>
<li><strong>Citrus Tahini Sauce</strong> &#8211; The tahini dressing is made using tahini, orange and lemon juice + zest, maple syrup, garlic, salt and water. You could also use your favorite vinaigrette.</li>
<li><strong>Chickpeas</strong> &#8211; I like to use a mild-flavored bean for this recipe, like chickpeas or white beans but any kind of beans will work. You could also serve with <a href="https://www.shelikesfood.com/easy-pan-fried-tofu/">tofu</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Quinoa</strong> &#8211; I like to serve my veggies over quinoa, but any grain would work. You could even use cauliflower rice if you prefer.</li>

<h2>How To Make Easy Roasted Vegetable Bowls</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pre-heat oven to 425 degrees F.</strong> Add all of your diced vegetables to an extra large sheet pan and drizzle them with olive oil. Add garlic powder, salt and pepper (and any other seasonings you may want) and use your hands to toss everything together until vegetables are fully coated and arrange them in a single layer on the baking sheet.</li>
<li><strong>Place veggies in the oven and roast until fork tender</strong> and beginning to caramelize, about 30-35 minutes, flipping once. Remove from the oven and let cool for a couple of minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Make the tahini sauce while the vegetables are roasting.</strong> Add all sauce ingredients, except for the water, to a medium-sized bowl, or jar, and mix until combined. Once the sauce gets thick, add a couple Tablespoons of water at a time and mix until desired thickness is reached. &nbsp;You could also add in extra citrus juice instead of water, if you like.</li>
<li><strong>Assemble your bowls.</strong> &nbsp;To each one, add about 3/4 cup quinoa, 1/2 cup chickpeas, and 1/4 of the roasted veggies. Drizzle with the desired amount of dressing and add extra salt or fresh herbs, to your liking.</li>

<li id="instruction-step-1">Pre-heat oven to 425 degrees F.  Add all of your diced vegetables to an extra large sheet pan and drizzle them with olive oil.  Add garlic powder, salt and pepper (and any other seasonings you may want) and use your hands to toss everything together until vegetables are fully coated and arrange them in a single layer on the baking sheet.</li>
<li id="instruction-step-2">Place veggies in the oven and roast until fork tender and beginning to caramelize, about 30-35 minutes, flipping once.  Remove from the oven and let cool for a couple of minutes.</li>
<li id="instruction-step-3">Make the tahini sauce while the vegetables are roasting.  Add all sauce ingredients, except for the water, to a medium sized bowl, or jar, and mix until combined.  Once the sauce gets thick, add a couple tablespoons of water at a time and mix until desired thickness is reached.  You could also add in extra citrus juice instead of water, if you like.</li>
<li id="instruction-step-4">Assemble you&#8217;re bowls.  To each one, add about 3/4 cup quinoa, 1/2 cup chickpeas and 1/4 of the roasted veggies.  Drizzle with desired amount of dressing and add extra salt or fresh herbs, if desired.</li>
