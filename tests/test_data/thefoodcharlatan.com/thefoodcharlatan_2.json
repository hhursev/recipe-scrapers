    "Start my making the Biscuits: Follow my favorite recipe for Flaky Buttermilk Biscuits. If you are in a hurry, make the Drop Biscuit Recipe found in the notes.",
    "Meanwhile, brown the sausage. Set a 12-inch high sided pan on a burner over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, add the bulk sausage. Use a wooden spoon to break up the meat, working quickly to spread it out and get a lot of surface contact with the pan. Let the sausage sit for 2-3 minutes undisturbed, until it is getting brown. Using a spatula, flip the sausage in small sections to brown the other side. (I use this method because I'm obsessed with crispy browned bits of sausage. If you stir the whole time it won't crisp as much. You do you boo, it's going to taste great no matter how you get it done.) Keep cooking until the sausage is no longer pink.",
    "Once the meat is fully cooked, turn the heat down to medium.",
    "Make roux: Add 1/2 cup (1 stick) of butter and 1 tablespoon of Roasted Chicken Better than Bouillon to the pan. Stir the butter and bouillon into the sausage.",
    "Add dry ingredients: Use a wooden spoon to stir in 1/4 cup flour, 1 and 1/2 tablespoons fresh chopped parsley (or 1/2 teaspoon dried), 1/2 teaspoon sage, 1/2 teaspoon thyme, 1 teaspoon kosher salt (use half the amount of table salt), 1/2 teaspoon freshly cracked pepper, and start with 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper. Cook for about 60 seconds to let the flour absorb the fat.",
    "Make gravy: SLOWLY pour in 2 cups of whole milk. Seriously, do not rush this or you will end up with flour lumps in your gravy. Pour in a few tablespoons milk while stirring. Stir it in until it absorbs. Add in another few tablespoons and repeat until the full 2 cups have been added and you have a nice gravy going.",
    "Add in additional milk. Continue adding milk until it is the consistency you like. I usually add anywhere from another 1 to 2 cups milk. Add it slowly in smallish increments.",
    "Taste and adjust seasonings: Taste your gravy and see what you think. Add freshly ground black pepper if you want more peppery flavor. Add a pinch more cayenne pepper and/or a pinch of red pepper flakes if you like it spicy.",
    "Simmer: Keep the heat at medium until the gravy is as thick as you like it, then bring the temperature down to low and leave it to simmer for 5 minutes or so. Keep the gravy on the stove, on low, stirring occasionally, until you are ready to serve it with the biscuits.",
    "The gravy will continue to thicken as time goes on, so if you have a wait before your biscuits are ready, you might want to stir in a bit more milk before serving.",
    "Serve: Split your biscuits on a plate, and carefully spoon the gravy over the top. Eat in insanely huge bites while your eyes roll into the back of your head.",
    "Storage: Store biscuits and gravy separate. Keep biscuits on the counter in a container with a sealing lid or in a ziplock bag so they don't dry out (refrigerate after 2 days.)Store in a tupperware in the refrigerator for about 4-5 days. I have never, ever had leftover sausage gravy last more than 2 days at my house!",
    "To freeze the sausage gravy, pour it into a ziplock freezer bag, get as much air out as you can, and seal. It will be good in the freezer for 2-3 months. When you want to eat the gravy, let the bag defrost in the refrigerator overnight. Once thaw, heat the gravy on medium low in a skillet or pot on the stove, adding milk until it is the consistency you want. To freeze the biscuits, set them all on a baking sheet and flash freeze in the freezer for about 30 minutes. Transfer them to a ziplock freezer bag, removing as much air as possible and sealing. The biscuits will only last for about a month, as they tend to dry out quickly in the cold, dry air of the freezer. To eat the biscuits, set the ziplock bag on the counter for 2-3 hours until no longer frozen. You can warm them in the microwave, toaster oven, or if doing a whole sheet, in a 175 degree oven until warm. Freeze unbaked biscuits: You can make your biscuit dough a day in advance and freeze them, shaped. Put them in the oven frozen solid and increase the bake time 1-2 minutes. This is a great make ahead option!"
