    "Place peeled, quartered potatoes in a pot of cold salted water. Bring to a boil and cook until tender.",
    "Meantime, brown onions & garlic in oil on med-low for 10 min.",
    "Drain and mash the potatoes, adding onion & garlic, cream cheese, salt & pepper. Set aside to cool. Shape into 1-tablespoon size mounds if desired.",
    "Combine flour & salt in a bowl. Make a well and add sour cream, egg & water, combining with a spoon.",
    "Place on a well-floured board and knead for 50 turns (using a scraper if needed) until smooth. Cover with a towel or inverted bowl & let rest at least 10 minutes.",
    "Divide dough into thirds. Keeping extra dough covered, roll each section 1/8” thick, adding flour as needed. Cut 3-inch circles, saving leftover scraps of dough.",
    "Fill each circle with about one tablespoon of potatoes, fold into a half circle, and pinch edges tightly. Place apart on a towel sprinkled with flour.",
    "Place pierogis in boiling salted water, stirring at first to keep them separated, and cook about 3 minutes until they rise to the top, then another 30 seconds to a minute. Remove to an oiled baking sheet."
