Meanwhile, pat chicken dry with paper towels. Coat in flour, shaking off excess. Then dip in egg (letting excess drip off). Dredge in breadcrumbs, turning twice and patting to adhere.\nCook chicken cutlets: Increase heat to medium-high. Working in batches, add chicken to skillet; cook, gently shaking skillet occasionally, until chicken is browned, about 4 minutes.
