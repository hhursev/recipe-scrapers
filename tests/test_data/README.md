Test Data
---------

As a precondition for inclusion in this library, each recipe scraper is required to include test coverage to demonstrate that it can accurately retrieve recipe information from the website it relates to.

To achieve that, the development source repository includes a minimal number of test HTML files from the public web -- often only one or two per recipe website -- to confirm the scraper's behaviour.  These test files are not included in the [published releases](https://pypi.org/project/recipe-scrapers/) of the library.

If you would prefer for any of them to be removed, there are at least two approaches available to you:

  * You may follow GitHub's [content removal request processes](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/submitting-content-removal-requests).

  * Alternatively you may contact us (the software maintainers of this library) and/or file a bugreport with us -- preferably from an email address associated with the recipe website, or otherwise proving ownership of the content you'd like us to remove.

Note that removal of test HTML may reduce our ability to support the affected website(s).
