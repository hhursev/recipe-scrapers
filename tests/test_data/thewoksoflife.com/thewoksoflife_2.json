    "In a medium bowl, add the sliced chicken, water, cornstarch, oil, and oyster sauce. Mix well until the chicken has absorbed all the liquid. Set aside while you prepare the other ingredients.",
    "In another medium bowl or measuring cup, make the sauce mixture. Combine the chicken stock, sugar, oyster sauce, soy sauce, dark soy sauce, sesame oil, and white pepper.",
    "Fill your wok halfway with water, and bring it to a boil. Add the broccoli and carrots. Blanch for 1 minute. Drain and set aside.",
    "Heat your wok over high heat until it’s completely dry and starting to smoke. Add 2 tablespoons neutral oil, and sear the chicken until opaque on all sides. Turn off the heat, remove the chicken, and set aside. The chicken will be about 75-80% done, but will be cooked again at the end.",
    "Without washing the wok, set the flame to medium heat. Add the remaining tablespoon of oil, along with the garlic, onion, mushrooms, and pepper. Cook for 30 seconds, then add the Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok.",
    "Then pour in the sauce mixture. Use your wok spatula to stir the sauce around the sides of the wok to deglaze, and let it come to a simmer. Simmer for 1 minute, until the vegetables are all crisp tender.",
    "Stir up the cornstarch and water slurry and drizzle the mixture into sauce while stirring constantly. Allow the sauce to simmer until thick and gravy-like, about 30 seconds.",
    "Toss in the chicken and its juices and the reserved broccoli and carrots. Stir-fry to coat the chicken in the sauce, cooking for another 30 seconds or so. Serve immediately with steamed rice."
