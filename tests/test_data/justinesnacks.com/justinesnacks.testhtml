<p>This Grilled Swordfish with Basil Pistachio Relish and Tomato Salad is my love letter to no-cooking cooking. It&#8217;s essentially all about chopping and mixing your way to the perfect summer dinner, with only the swordfish to take care of. This meal is bright, wholesome, supremely fresh and perfect if you are looking to whip something up in 30 minutes. Plus you just need one chopping board, but you&#8217;ll still be left with something bursting with flavors and textures. This recipe will not let you down if you are looking for something elegant, yet simple, to put on the dinner table. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-make-the-basil-pistachio-relish">How to make the basil pistachio relish</h2>



<p>This relish brings the whole dish together. It&#8217;s simple, fresh and bright, making the swordfish really shine. Here&#8217;s how to make it:</p>



<p>Finely chop the basil. Use your knife in a rocking motion to mince it into very small pieces, you want the herbs to be as fine as possible.<br>Add the pistachios to the cutting board and chop them into the basil, leaving no piece larger than the tip of a pencil eraser.<br>Add the basil and pistachios to a bowl. Grate in the garlic and squeeze in the juice from one lemon. Pour in a generous glug of olive oil, stir and season with salt to taste. You want the mixture to be thick but still viscous, like a herby salsa. Set this aside.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-prepare-the-tomato-amp-plum-salad">How to prepare the tomato &amp; plum salad</h2>



<p>Tomatoes and plums are a match made in heaven. I love the acidic flavors that they share, and when placed under a hearty cut of swordfish, it&#8217;s the perfect meal. </p>



<p>To make it, remove the stems from the tomatoes and cut them into large pieces. I prefer slices. Do the same with the cherry plums. Add both to a large bowl.<br>Thinly slice the red onion, tear the mint and dill with your hands. Add both of these into the bowl with the tomatoes and cherry plums and gently toss everything together. Add a drizzle of good olive oil and salt and pepper to taste. This salad is nothing fancy, I just like to let the ingredients shine.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-grill-the-swordfish-and-bring-this-recipe-together">How to grill the swordfish and bring this recipe together</h2>



<p>Swordfish is the best fish for this dish because of its meaty texture, yet light flavor. It&#8217;s not too flakey and holds up to the tomato salad, but compliments the bright herbs and juices. Here&#8217;s how to grill the swordfish:</p>



<p>Bring a cast iron or grill pan to medium heat. Add in the avocado oil. While the oil is heating up, season the swordfish fillets with salt and pepper on each side. Grill the swordfish for 5-6 minutes, or until it releases from the pan. Then flip and cook for an additional 3-4 minutes.<br>To serve, add a heaping portion of the salad to a plate, then add the swordfish. Top the swordfish with the basil pistachio relish and enjoy with a very crispy glass of white wine.</p>

Finely chop the basil. Use your knife in a rocking motion to mince it into very small pieces, you want the herbs to be as fine as possible. </span></div></li><li id="wprm-recipe-9972-step-0-1" class="wprm-recipe-instruction" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><div class="wprm-recipe-instruction-text" style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><span style="display: block;">Add the pistachios to the cutting board and chop them into the basil, leaving no piece larger than the tip of a pencil eraser. </span></div></li><li id="wprm-recipe-9972-step-0-2" class="wprm-recipe-instruction" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><div class="wprm-recipe-instruction-text" style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><span style="display: block;">Add the basil and pistachios to a bowl. Grate in the garlic and squeeze in the juice from one lemon. Pour in a generous glug of olive oil, stir and season with salt to taste. You want the mixture to be thick but still viscous, like an herby salsa. Set this aside. </span></div></li><li id="wprm-recipe-9972-step-0-3" class="wprm-recipe-instruction" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><div class="wprm-recipe-instruction-text" style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><span style="display: block;">Remove the stems from the tomatoes and cut them into large pieces. I prefer slices. Do the same with the cherry plums. Add both to a large bowl. </span></div></li><li id="wprm-recipe-9972-step-0-4" class="wprm-recipe-instruction" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><div class="wprm-recipe-instruction-text" style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><span style="display: block;">Thinly slice the red onion, tear the mint and dill with your hands. Add both of these into the bowl with the tomatoes and cherry plums and gently toss everything together. Add a drizzle of good olive oil and salt and pepper to taste. This salad is nothing fancy, I just like to let the ingredients shine. </span></div></li><li id="wprm-recipe-9972-step-0-5" class="wprm-recipe-instruction" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><div class="wprm-recipe-instruction-text" style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><span style="display: block;">Lastly, bring a cast iron or grill pan to medium heat. Add in the avocado oil. While the oil is heating up, season the swordfish fillets with salt and pepper on each side. Grill the swordfish for 5-6 minutes, or until it releases from the pan. Then flip and cook for an additional 3-4 minutes. </span></div></li><li id="wprm-recipe-9972-step-0-6" class="wprm-recipe-instruction" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><div class="wprm-recipe-instruction-text" style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><span style="display: block;">To serve, add a heaping portion of the salad to a plate, then add the swordfish. Top the swordfish with the basil pistachio relish and enjoy with a very crispy glass of white wine. </span></div></li></ul></div></div>

And thank you to @wanderingbearco, who I am SO excited to work with this year as a long-term partner!! Their cold brew is the best I’ve come across (vanilla for life, but mocha and original are also great). I’m very excited to work with them…because…cold brew. 

The full recipe will be on the blog shortly, but it’s in the VO for now! 🤎

If you’ve read the intro of my book, you know salsa verde is one of my favorite condiments, it’s so simple but so good, and I’ve broken down the ratios in weight on my blog so you really can’t mess it up.

This is pink salmon, one of the five salmon varieties that is wild-caught in Alaska. It’s tender and mild in flavor, and I love using it to 1) support Alaska fishermen and 2) get the best quality and taste. I’m thrilled to be working with @alaskaseafood again! And if you can, remember to #AskforAlaska
