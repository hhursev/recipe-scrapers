  "title": "Classic Crème Brûlée",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 ½ cups (375 mL) whipping cream (35%)",
    "4 egg yolks",
    "¼ cup (60 mL) granulated sugar",
    "1 tsp vanilla extract",
    "4-6 tsp granulated sugar, for caramelizing"
  ],
  "instructions_list": [
    "Preheat oven to 325°F (160°C). Place four 1/2 cup (125 mL) ramekins or custard cups in a baking dish. Set aside. Heat cream in saucepan over medium-high heat until small bubbles form around edge of pan. Meanwhile, whisk egg yolks and a 1/4 cup of sugar until thick and lemon-coloured – about 1 to 2 minutes.",
    "When cream is hot, gradually whisk into egg yolk mixture. Stir in vanilla. Pour mixture through sieve into ramekins, dividing evenly. Pour very hot water into baking dish to reach halfway up ramekins. Carefully place baking dish in oven. Bake until mostly set but with a slight jiggle in the centre, about 30 to 35 minutes for taller ramekins (about 2 inches (5 cm) high), and 25 to 30 minutes for shallow ramekins (about 1 inch (2.5 cm) high). Carefully remove ramekins from water. Cool on wire rack. When cool, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for least 2 hours and up to 2 days.",
    "Just before serving (or up to 2 hours before serving), sprinkle sugar evenly over surface of desserts (1 tsp for taller ramekins and 1-1/2 tsp for shallow ramekins). Using a mini torch or by placing the ramekins directly under the broiler, heat until sugar melts and caramelizes. Serve immediately, or for a firmer texture, chill until serving time."
