    "Preheat oven to 325ยบ and butter an 8\" or 9\" springform pan. Make crust: In a food processor, blend Oreos with melted butter and salt. Pat into a springform pan and set aside while you make filling.",
    "Make cheesecake: In a large bowl using a hand mixer, beat cream cheese and sugar until completely smooth and fluffy. Add cornstarch, then add eggs. Add Baileys and vanilla.",
    "Pour batter into crust and place on a large baking sheet.",
    "Bake until center of cheesecake is only slightly jiggly, 1 hour 20 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes. Let cheesecake cool in oven, 1 hour, then refrigerate until completely cool, 4 hours or up to overnight. (If you'd like to use a water bath, tightly wrap outside of springform pan with two layers of aluminum foil. Transfer to a deep roasting pan and pour in enough boiling water to reach halfway up the cheesecake pan. Bake as directed.)",
    "When ready to serve, make ganache: In a small saucepan over low heat, heat heavy cream. Place chocolate in a heatproof bowl and pour hot cream on top. Let sit 3 minutes, then stir until creamy, until no lumps remain. Refrigerate ganache until slightly thick, 15 minutes, and spread all over cheesecake. Let set 10 minutes, then serve."
