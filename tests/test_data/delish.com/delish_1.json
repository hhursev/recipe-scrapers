When cake is done baking, flip onto kitchen towel and gently peel off parchment paper.\nStarting at a short end, gently but tightly roll cake into a log. Let cool completely.\nFor the filling:\nIn a large bowl, combine cream cheese, melted butter, and salt. Using a hand mixer, whisk until light and fluffy.\nAdd powdered sugar and vanilla and continue to mix until smooth.\nWhen cake is cooled, gently unroll (it’s ok if it remains slightly curled) and spread with cream cheese filling. Roll back up and dust with more powdered sugar. Slice and serve.",
