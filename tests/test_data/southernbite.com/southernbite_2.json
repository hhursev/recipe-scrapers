Stir well.\nCook until the mixture reaches the soft ball stage (235°F) using a candy thermometer.\nAdd peanuts and stir constantly. Seriously. Constantly.\nCook until the mixture reaches the hard crack stage (300°F). The peanuts might start popping and you might see a little smoke come off the mixture. Remove it form the heat as soon as it hits the 300°F mark. It'll scorch if you get it too hot.\nQuickly add the butter, vanilla, and baking soda. The baking soda will cause the mixture to lighten and foam up. Don’t freak out, it’s supposed to do that. Stir well.\nPour on the prepared aluminum foil. Spread thin and allow to cool.\nBreak into pieces and enjoy.",
