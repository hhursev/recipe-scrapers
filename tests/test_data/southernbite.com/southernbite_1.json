The goal is to get the shortening cut into tiny pea-size pieces.\nAdd the water and stir until combined. Use your hands to gently knead the dough until it holds together.\nTurn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and roll the dough into a thin rectangle that is about 10x16-inches. Spread the soft butter to cover the dough then sprinkle with the sugar and nutmeg (or cinnamon). Carefully and tightly roll the dough up jelly roll or cinnamon roll style and pinch to seal the long edge. Cut the dough into 12 even rolls and place them into the prepared dish.\nMake the sauce:\nCombine the milk and sugar in a small pot over medium high heat. Stir until the milk just begins to bubble. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla. Pour the mixture over the rolls.\nBake uncovered for 35 to 45 minutes or until the rolls are brown on the tops. Serve warm.",
