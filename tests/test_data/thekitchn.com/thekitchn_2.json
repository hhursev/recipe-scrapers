    "Step 1",
    "Fit a wire rack inside a baking sheet. Pat 4 cube steaks dry with paper towels. Season the steaks on both sides with 1 teaspoon of the kosher salt. Place the steaks on the rack.",
    "Step 2",
    "Place the remaining 1 teaspoon kosher salt, 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, 2 tablespoons cornstarch, 1 teaspoon black pepper, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon onion powder, and 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika in a large shallow bowl or pie dish, and whisk to combine. Place 1/2 cup buttermilk and 1 large egg in a second shallow bowl or pie plate and whisk until smooth.",
    "Step 3",
    "Working with one steak at a time, dip into the buttermilk mixture to coat, then press into the flour mixture until thoroughly coated. Return the steaks to the rack and let sit for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, reserve 1/4 cup of the flour mixture for the gravy. Heat the oven and prepare for frying.",
    "Step 4",
    "Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to warm or 225°F. Fit a wire rack onto a baking sheet.",
    "Step 5",
    "Heat 1 cup vegetable oil in a large regular or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until about 350ºF, about 8 minutes. You can test the oil by dropping a pinch of the breading into the oil — it should sizzle and brown quickly.",
    "Step 6",
    "Using tongs, carefully add 2 of the steaks to the oil and fry until golden-brown on the bottom with no remaining flour or batter lumps, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip the steaks and fry until the second is browned, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer the steaks to the clean wire rack and place in the oven. Fry the remaining steaks.",
    "Step 7",
    "Carefully pour the frying oil into a heatproof bowl (do not discard). Don't scrape or clean the skillet. Return 1/4 cup of the oil to the skillet over medium-high heat. Whisk in the reserved 1/4 cup flour mixture and cook, whisking continuously, until golden-brown, about 3 minutes. Add 2 cups whole milk and whisk to combine. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 5 to 6 minutes. Season with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper.",
    "Step 8",
    "Serve the steaks with a generous ladling of the gravy."
