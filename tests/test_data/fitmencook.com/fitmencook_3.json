    "1.5 tbsp The Fit Cook Land Spice Blend Land Herb & Garlic blend (no salt added) $14.99 Add to Cart",
    "2 tbsp Taco Titan Adjust to taste Taco Titan (no salt added) $14.99 Add to Cart",
    "1 tsp ground cumin",
    "2.5 g bay leaves 2",
    "6 cup low-sodium chicken broth",
    "14.5 oz can diced tomatoes (no salt added)",

  "instructions_list": [
    "Build the base & brown the turkey. Heat a large pot over medium-high heat. Sauté diced onions and bell peppers for 4-5 minutes until softened. Add minced garlic and cook 1 minute. Stir in Land Herb and Garlic Blend (1.5 tbsp), cook 30 seconds to bloom. Add 2 lbs ground turkey, breaking it into small pieces as it cooks for 6-8 minutes until no pink remains. Pro-tip: I removed the veggies and cooked the turkey in batches. Adding it all at once will produce too much steam, and the turkey will boil and not sear. Try adding 1/2 cup to 1 cup at a time.",
    "Season & add liquid. When turkey is nearly finished, (add back in the veggies if you separated them), then generously add Taco Titan ( start with 2 tbsp, taste and adjust ). Add 1 tsp cumin and stir well. Pour in 6 cups chicken broth and bay leaves. Scrape the bottom of the pan with a spatula to “deglaze” any seasoning stuck on the bottom – that’s the natural flavor packet! Bring to a rolling boil (3-4 minutes).",
    "Simmer & thicken. Stir in canned diced tomatoes and drained black beans. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered for 20-30 minutes until liquid reduces to around 5 cups. Add 2-3 tbsp tomato paste (or more/less depending on your desired soup consistency), stir thoroughly, and simmer 5 – 10 minutes more, then set aside to cool and thicken.",
    "OPTIONAL – Make high protein crema. While soup finishes, blend together 1 cup Greek yogurt, 3-4 tbsp water, and 1 shredded mozzarella stick chopped into pieces (string cheese) until smooth and pourable. *** For best results , use the soup setting on your blender – the added heat breaks down the mozzarella so it incorporates and is not grainy.*** If you don’t have a blender, just mix a few tablespoons water with the Greek yogurt to make it pourable.",
    "Scoop rice into bowls as the base, ladle soup over it. Top with optional crema drizzle, pico de gallo, Citrus Pepper pinch , cilantro, red onion, and avocado if using."
