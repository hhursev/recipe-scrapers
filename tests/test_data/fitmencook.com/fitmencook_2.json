  "ingredients": [
    "213g (1 cup) leftover potato burrito filling",
    "4 tablespoons rolled oats or all-purpose flour (add as needed) * sturdier crust",
    "sturdier crust",
    "5 large eggs",
    "2 tablespoons milk or water",
    "1/4 cup leftover shredded cheese *",
    "pinch of garlic powder, onion powder, or your favorite seasonings"
  ],
  "instructions_list": [
    "Preheat oven to 400°F. Then spray a 6-cup muffin tin generously with cooking oil.",
    "Make the potato, turkey, & bean crust: If using oats or flour for extra structure, start by mixing 3-4 tablespoons into the leftover potato burrito filling in a small bowl. The mixture should hold together when pressed and not be loose or runny. If it’s still too wet, add another 1-2 teaspoons at a time until it reaches the right consistency.",
    "Divide the filling evenly among the 6 muffin cups (about 2-3 tablespoons per cup). Press the filling firmly into the bottom and slightly up the sides of each muffin cup to create a crust. Bake for 18-20 minutes until the filling is set and slightly dried out. This creates a firm base that won’t mix with the eggs. Then remove from the oven and let it cool for 3-5 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350°F.",
    "While the crusts are baking, whisk together the eggs, milk, salt, pepper, and any optional seasonings in a bowl until well combined. Stir in optional shredded cheese. Carefully pour the egg mixture into each muffin cup over the potato crust, filling about ¾ of the way full (don’t overfill or the eggs may overflow).",
    "Bake at 350°F for 18-22 minutes, or until the eggs are set and lightly golden on top. A toothpick inserted in the center should come out clean. Let it cool for 3-5 minutes before carefully removing from the muffin tin using a butter knife or small spatula."
