    "Preheat the oven",
    "If using freshly made dough, preheat an oven with a pizza steel/stone in the top rack. Switch the oven to the broiler function on high.",
    "Mix & spread the meat onto the flabreads.",
    "Meanwhile, mix all meat spread components until the meat is tacky. Cook a tiny spoonful of it in the microwave to check seasoning, and add ingredients if needed. Spread a very thin layer of the meat mixture onto a flatbread. Repeat with remaining flatbreads until youâ€™ve run out of meat.",
