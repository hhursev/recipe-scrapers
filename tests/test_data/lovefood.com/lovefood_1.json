  "title": "Butterscotch and pecan shortbread biscuits recipe",
  "ingredients": [
    "85 g butterscotch candies",
    "50 g pecans",
    "200 g unsalted butter, softened",
    "100 g caster sugar, plus extra for sprinkling",
    "1 tsp vanilla paste",
    "250 g plain flour, plus extra for dusting",
    "25 g cornflour",
    "25 g rice flour",
    "0.5 tsp baking powder",
    "0.5 tsp fine salt"
  ],
  "instructions_list": [
    "Line two baking trays (baking sheets) with baking paper (baking parchment).",
    "To make the shortbread dough, break the butterscotch candies and pecans into small pieces, about half the size of a pea.",
    "In the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the beater, cream together the butter, sugar and vanilla on medium speed for about three minutes, until pale and creamy.",
    "Scrape down the sides of the bowl, then sift in the flour, cornflour (cornstarch), rice flour, baking powder and salt and mix until almost combined.",
    "Add the chopped butterscotch and pecans and mix slowly, until the pieces are evenly distributed.",
    "Turn the mixture out onto a lightly floured work surface and divide it in half. Shape each half into a log-shape with a diameter of roughly 5-6cm (2-2.5in).",
    "Wrap the logs tightly in baking paper (baking parchment), twist the ends to seal and roll the logs back and forth on the work surface to neaten. Chill in the fridge for two hours, until very firm.",
    "Preheat the oven to 170°C/150°C fan/325°F/gas mark 3. To bake the biscuits, unwrap the shortbread logs and, using a sharp knife, cut them into 1cm (0.5in) discs. Arrange the discs on the lined baking trays (baking sheets), leaving a little space between each one.",
    "Sprinkle the top of the shortbreads with a little sugar and bake for 12-13 minutes, until firm and starting to turn golden at the edges.",
    "If any nuggets of butterscotch have escaped from the sides of the baked shortbreads, gently push them back into shape with a palette knife while the biscuits are still hot.",
    "Leave to cool on the baking trays (baking sheets) for five minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack until cold. The shortbreads will keep for up to seven days in an airtight container."
