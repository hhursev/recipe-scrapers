    "Make the cucumber pickle by thinly slicing the cucumber and shallot with a mandoline. Place in a non-metallic bowl with the sugar, vinegar and a small pinch of salt. Stir to mix and set aside for at least 30 minutes.",
    "Add the potatoes to a pan of salted boiling water, bring back to the boil and simmer for 4 minutes. Drain and spread out on a tray lined with kitchen towel to dry.",
    "Slice the beef fillet into 1cm thick strips. Set aside.",
    "Melt 15g of the butter in a large, deep, heavy-based frying pan and add the onion and paprika. Season, cover with a piece of greaseproof paper and the pan lid and sweat over a very low heat for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onion is soft. Lift the onions from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside.",
    "Meanwhile, heat the sunflower oil in another large frying pan over a medium-high heat and add half the potatoes. Fry, turning occasionally, for 6-7 minutes or until the potatoes are browned. Transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper and add the remaining potatoes to the pan. Fry until browned, then add to the tray of potatoes and keep warm in a low oven.",
    "Melt 15g of the butter in the pan and add the mushrooms. Season and fry over a medium heat, stirring, for 8-10 minutes or until the mushrooms are tender and any liquid has evaporated. Add to the onions.",
    "Melt the remaining butter in the pan and place over a high heat. Add the beef fillet and fry for 30 seconds. Flip and fry for 30 more seconds. Pour the brandy into the pan and light it - the flames will leap up, so be prepared for that. When the flames have died down, remove the steak from the pan.",
    "Return the onions and mushrooms to the pan and pour in the sour cream. Warm over a very low heat for 2-3 minutes, stirring, until the sauce is heated through. Slide the steak back into the pan with any juices and stir to coat. Season to taste. Serve the beef Stroganoff with the sautéed potatoes and cucumber pickle, garnished with chopped fresh parsley."
