    "Add the onion and butter to the bottom of the slow cooker. Place the chicken breasts on top. Sprinkle the dried thyme, garlic powder, salt and pepper over the chicken breasts and add the bay leaves to the pot. Pour in the chicken broth.",
    "Cover and cook on high for 3-4 hours or low for 6-7 hours, until chicken is cooked through and tender.",
    "When the cook time is almost done, make the dumpling dough. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt. Pour in the milk and melted butter and stir with a fork until the dough comes together. Put in the refrigerator for a few minutes while you shred the chicken.",
    "Make a cornstarch slurry by whisking together the 2 tablespoons cornstarch and 2 tablespoons water in a small bowl. Set aside. Remove the chicken to a clean plate or bowl. Remove and discard the bay leaves. Stir the cornstarch slurry and frozen vegetables into the slow cooker and put the lid back on. If you had been cooking on low, switch the slow cooker to the high setting because the dumplings need to be cooked on high.",
    "Shred the chicken. Stir the shredded chicken into the slow cooker.",
    "Working quickly so as to not have the lid off of the slow cooker for too long, scoop small spoonfuls (about 1 tablespoon each) of the dumpling dough and place in a single layer on top of the soup in the slow cooker. There may be some space in between the dumplings; they will expand some as they cook. Spoon a little of the broth over each of the dumplings. Cover and cook for 1 ½ - 2 hours on high, until the dumplings are cooked through. Serve."
