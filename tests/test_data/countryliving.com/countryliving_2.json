    "Make the crust: Whisk together flour and salt in a bowl. Cut in butter with a pastry blender or two forks until the dough is shaggy. Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, using a fork to pull dough together into a crumbly pile, adding up to an additional 2 tablespoons of water, if needed. Divide dough into two portions, wrap in plastic wrap, using the plastic to flatten and press dough into a disk. Refrigerate until firm, 1 hour.",
    "Preheat oven to 350°F with the rack in the middle positions. On a lightly floured surface, roll one disk of dough to 1/8-inch thickness. Fit dough in the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie plate. Turn edges under and crimp. Freeze 15 minutes and up to 2 days.",
    "Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. On a lightly floured surface, roll second disk of dough to 1/8-inch thickness. Cut 6 3/4-inch strips using a knife or pastry cutter and 5 stars using a 1 1/2-inch star-shaped cookie cutter. Transfer to prepared baking sheet. Freeze 15 minutes and up to 2 days.",
    "Make the filling and assemble: Line a second rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk together sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a bowl. Add berries and gently stir until coated. Transfer berries and any remaining sugar to pie shell. Arrange crust strips and stars in a flag shape on top. Bake on prepared baking sheet until lightly brown and bubbly, 55 to 60 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack."
