    "PREPARE YOUR WORK STATION",
    "Combine 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon together in a shallow bowl for your cinnamon sugar coating.",
    "Line a large plate with a double layer of paper towel ready for your cooked churros.",
    "Fill a large pot or deep skillet with 1 1/2 - 2 cups of oil.",
    "MAKE THE BEST CHURRO DOUGH",
    "Heat the butter in a medium-sized saucepan. Add in the water, sugar, vanilla, cinnamon and salt. Bring to a simmer for 5 minutes while mixing occasionally. Add in the flour, stirring with a large wooden spoon until well blended and forms a ball.",
    "Take off heat and allow to cool for 10 minutes, or until just warm to the touch.",
    "While dough is cooling, heat oil over medium-high heat to 360°F (180°C).",
    "Once dough has cooled, add one egg, quickly beating until completely incorporated (it will look like it's not coming together, but keep beating)! Add in the second egg and repeat the process until a dough forms.",
    "Scoop dough into a strong double lined pastry bag with a large open star tip nozzle. (I suggest using Wilton 1M or Ateco 845/846.)",
    "COOK CHURROS",
    "Lightly oil the blade end of your scissors and set aside. Carefully pipe 5-6-inch long strips of dough into hot oil, cutting the ends with oiled scissors. Fry 4-5 churros at a time to avoid over-crowding your pot.",
    "Fry until golden browned, about 2 minutes each side. Transfer to paper towel lined plate for a few seconds, then roll in the cinnamon sugar.",
    "Repeat with remaining dough.",
    "Serve warm with melted chocolate or caramel sauce, fruit or ice cream."
