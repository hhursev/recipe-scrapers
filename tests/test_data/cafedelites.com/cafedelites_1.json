Add in the water, sugar, vanilla, cinnamon and salt. Bring to a simmer for 5 minutes while mixing occasionally. Add in the flour, stirring with a large wooden spoon until well blended and forms a ball.\nTake off heat and allow to cool for 10 minutes, or until just warm to the touch.\nWhile dough is cooling, heat oil over medium-high heat to 360°F (180°C).\nOnce dough has cooled, add one egg, quickly beating until completely incorporated (it will look like it's not coming together, but keep beating)! Add in the second egg and repeat the process until a dough forms.\nScoop dough into a strong double lined pastry bag with a large open star tip nozzle. (I suggest using Wilton 1M or Ateco 845/846.)\nCOOK CHURROS\nLightly oil the blade end of your scissors and set aside. Carefully pipe 5-6-inch long strips of dough into hot oil, cutting the ends with oiled scissors. Fry 4-5 churros at a time to avoid over-crowding your pot.\nFry until golden browned, about 2 minutes each side. Transfer to paper towel lined plate for a few seconds, then roll in the cinnamon sugar.\nRepeat with remaining dough.\nServe warm with melted chocolate or caramel sauce, fruit or ice cream.",
