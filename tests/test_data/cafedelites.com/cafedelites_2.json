  "ingredients": [
    "2 pounds (1kg) potatoes, ((Russet, Yukon Gold, Dutch Creams, Creme Gold, Creme Royale))",
    "1 teaspoon salt",
    "1/2 cup hot milk, (or more)",
    "1/3 cup unsalted butter, (softened (close to room temp is best))",
    "6-8 cloves fresh garlic (finely chopped)",
    "1/4 cup sour cream ((reduced fat))",
    "1/4 cup fresh shredded parmesan cheese, (optional)",
    "Salt and Pepper, (to taste)",
    "1 tablespoon fresh chopped parsley to garnish, (optional to garnish)"
  ],
  "instructions_list": [
    "Peel and cut potatoes into quarters lengthwise. Remove any spots, lumps or knots.",
    "Place potatoes in a large pot (6-quart) and cover with cold, salted water by an inch. Bring to a boil, reduce heat down to medium-low and allow to simmer until fork tender (about 15-20 minutes).",
    "When potatoes are just about done (nearly fork-tender), heat 1 tablespoon of the butter in a small pan over medium-high heat. Sauté garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute. Set aside and keep warm.",
    "Drain cooked potatoes, add in the remaining butter, cooked garlic, hot milk and sour cream.",
    "Mash the potatoes with a potato masher until smooth, adding a little extra milk if needed. (OPTIONAL: Use a strong wooden spoon OR electric beaters to beat further until smooth. Be careful NOT to over beat or they will become gluey.)",
    "Add in the parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste."

      "reviewBody": "I love these potatoes.  Unfortunately, as I was chopping the garlic, it did not smell good to me.  I used garlic salt instead and it was delicious anyhow (thank goodness!).  Next time I will cut back on the amount of milk I used as I like them thicker.  Not use to making mashed potatoes, but the more I do, the more familiar I’ll be when adding liquids.  Very flavorful!"

      "reviewBody": "Take a whole head of garlic and cut off the tip. Wrap with foil but before closing drizzle olive oil into the cut end with it facing up. Put in the oven at 350 for half an hour. Once unwrapped cool and squeeze the cloves into the potato mixture. Very mild on the stomach this way."
