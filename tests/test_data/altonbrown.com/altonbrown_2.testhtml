Frequently seen in yakitori restaurants, it&#39;s basically a fairly narrow box made of diatomaceous earth. Konros can be used with grill grates, (which I prefer) or, if you&#39;re using flat skewers (which prevent rolling) you can simply rest the ends on the sides of the grill. I have two Konros and I love the short one (a mere 12&quot; x 9&quot;) so much that I&#39;ve written several sonnets to it. When loaded with Japanese binchotan charcoal, it&#39;s simply the perfect grill for small pieces of food and skewers.If you have yet to acquire a Konro, I suggest building a small charcoal fire on your grill&#39;s coal grate, between four fireplace bricks arranged thusly...and topped with a small, steel cooling grate. In any case the fire should be medium hot so that a hand held an inch over the grate can only be kept there for a second, (unless you&#39;re like Gary Busey&#39;s character in Lethal Weapon, in which case I can&#39;t help you). If you don&#39;t want to mess with the bricks fine...weave two folded over (2-ply) strips of heavy-duty aluminum foil through your grill grates, parallel to each other at a distance that matches the length of the skewers taken up by the meat. Lay a small metal cooling rack on top (so that the skewers don&#39;t fall through the grates) and cook over a hot fire. The foil should protect the ends of the skewers from full on combustion.And yet another note: Since they tend to float, I soak my skewers in a plastic water bottle. When I need one, I just open the lid and kinda pour them out. This is far more efficient than soaking in a loaf pan or baking dish.","name":"Note: My favorite grill for satay, or kushiyake is known as a Konro.

Although there&#039;s plenty of sweetness in the marinade (sodas like ginger ale are frequent additions), it&#039;s framed by the acidic heat of a dipping sauce which, with its vinegar and garlic, reminds me of quite a few Eastern Carolina barbecue sauces.

Frequently seen in yakitori restaurants, it&#39;s basically a fairly narrow box made of diatomaceous earth. Konros can be used with grill grates, (which I prefer) or, if you&#39;re using flat skewers (which prevent rolling) you can simply rest the ends on the sides of the grill. I have two Konros and I love the short one (a mere 12&quot; x 9&quot;) so much that I&#39;ve written several sonnets to it. When loaded with Japanese binchotan charcoal, it&#39;s simply the perfect grill for small pieces of food and skewers.</span><div class="wprm-spacer"></div><span style="display: block;">If you have yet to acquire a Konro, I suggest building a small charcoal fire on your grill&#39;s coal grate, between four fireplace bricks arranged thusly...and topped with a small, steel cooling grate. In any case the fire should be medium hot so that a hand held an inch over the grate can only be kept there for a second, (unless you&#39;re like Gary Busey&#39;s character in Lethal Weapon, in which case I can&#39;t help you). If you don&#39;t want to mess with the bricks fine...weave two folded over (2-ply) strips of heavy-duty aluminum foil through your grill grates, parallel to each other at a distance that matches the length of the skewers taken up by the meat. Lay a small metal cooling rack on top (so that the skewers don&#39;t fall through the grates) and cook over a hot fire. The foil should protect the ends of the skewers from full on combustion.</span><div class="wprm-spacer"></div><span style="display: block;">And yet another note: Since they tend to float, I soak my skewers in a plastic water bottle. When I need one, I just open the lid and kinda pour them out. This is far more efficient than soaking in a loaf pan or baking dish.</span></div></li></ul></div></div>
