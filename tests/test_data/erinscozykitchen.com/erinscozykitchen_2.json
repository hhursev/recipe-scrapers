    "Place garlic cloves in a small saucepan and cover with oil.",
    "Cook over low heat (oil should just bubble gently, ~90–95 °C / 195–205 °F) until cloves are soft and golden, 20–30 minutes.",
    "Cool slightly. Drain cloves (reserve oil).",
    "Blend confit garlic with softened butter until smooth. Store in fridge up to 2 weeks.",
    "In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta until just shy of al dente. Reserve ½ cup pasta water.",
    "In a pan, heat garlic oil over medium-low heat. Add onions and cook slowly, stirring often, until deep golden and sweet (10–15 minutes).",
    "Stir in chili oil. Keep heat at medium-low; let spices open up for 30–60 seconds.",
    "Drop in 6 tbsp garlic confit butter. Let it melt fully into the onions. Keep heat gentle to avoid separating the butter.",
    "Stir in soy sauce and honey.",
    "Lower heat to low. Pour in heavy cream and stir until smooth. Let it simmer gently for 2–3 minutes — do not boil.",
    "With heat still on low, sprinkle parmesan directly into the cream sauce. Stir until fully melted and smooth. The sauce should look glossy and slightly thickened.",
    "Add pasta and a splash of pasta water. Toss vigorously over low heat until the sauce clings to the noodles. If too thick, loosen with more pasta water.",
    "Stir in parsley. Serve with extra chili oil and parmesan."
