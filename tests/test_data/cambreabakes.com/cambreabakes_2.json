    "Brown the Butter",
    "Cook the butter in a pot over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the bottom is covered in browned milk solids, is amber in color, and it smells nutty. Pour the butter into a dish and chill in the fridge for 1-2 hours, stirring well every 30 minutes, until the butter is solidified but has a spreadable consistency. You can also brown the butter the day before and leave it in the fridge to chill overnight. The next day, let it come to room temperature before using it.",
    "Make the Cinnamon Roll Dough",
    "For the tangzhong, whisk together the water and flour in a pot. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, for 4-5 minutes or until the mixture is a paste-like slurry. Scrape it into a bowl and set it aside until ready to use.",
    "In a stand mixing bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, yeast, and salt until combined. Then add the cream, milk, egg, vanilla, and tangzhong. Knead on low speed with the dough hook until it forms a rough dough ball.",
    "With the mixer running on low, add the browned butter a spoonful at a time, letting it fully incorporate into the dough before adding more. Then, continue kneading for another 11-12 minutes or until the dough looks smooth and elastic.",
    "Form the dough into a smooth, round ball and return it to the mixing bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes.",
    "Make the Filling",
    "Combine the brown butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon until smooth.",
    "Assemble the Cinnamon Rolls",
    "Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and sprinkle more flour on top. Roll it out into a 15”x 21” rectangle, with the longest side closest to you. Dollop the cinnamon sugar mixture across the surface of the dough, then use an offset spatula to gently spread it across, leaving a 1-inch border clean at the top. Don’t be too aggressive with spreading it, or you’ll tear the dough!",
    "Use a pizza cutter to cut twelve 1 3/4-inch strips. Roll each strip away from you, then carefully transfer it to a parchment-lined metal 9x13 baking pan.",
    "Cover the pan with plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours or until the rolls double in size. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 325 F/162 C.",
    "Bake the rolls for 25-35 minutes or until the tops are barely golden brown.",
    "While the rolls are baking, make the cream cheese frosting. In a stand mixing bowl, combine the cream cheese and brown butter until well combined. (You should have just enough leftover brown butter for the frosting. It's okay if it's slightly under or over!) Then, mix in the powdered sugar. Keep beating on low speed until the frosting is light and fluffy, then mix in the vanilla and heavy cream.",
    "Once baked, let the pan cool on a wire cooling rack for 15 minutes, then spread the brown butter frosting on top. Enjoy!"
