    "Crush the cookies in a large bag or in a food processor into a fine crumb.",
    "Stir or blend in the melted butter then press it into a 9-inch pie pan and refrigerate until the filling is ready.",
    "Add the chocolate, 1 cup of the milk, sugar, vanilla, and salt together in a medium saucepan and whisk continuously until the chocolate is fully melted. (It will be a little thick, but it should be fully melted.)",
    "Remove the pan from the heat and whisk for 1 minute.",
    "Next, whisk eggs, rest of the milk, and cornstarch together in a medium bowl then gradually whisk in 2 tablespoons of the melted chocolate at a time into the eggs until it is fully combined. (This will temper the eggs so that they don’t scramble when you put the pan back on the heat.)",
    "Pour all the filling back into the saucepan and place it back over medium-low heat while you whisk continuously to prevent burning.",
    "Use a rubber spatula occasionally to scrape down the chocolate from the sides and to get into the corners so that they don’t burn.",
    "Continue whisking until the mixture reaches a thinner pudding texture and coats the back of a spoon.",
    "Remove the pan from the heat and continue whisking gently for 5 more minutes then pour it over the pie crust and LET THE PIE SIT AT ROOM TEMPERATURE FOR 1 HOUR TO COOL BEFORE MOVING TO THE REFRIGERATOR.",
    "Cover tightly with plastic wrap then refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to 8 hours.",
    "Right before serving, whip the heavy cream and powdered sugar together in a medium bowl until stiff peaks form.",
    "Spread it all over the pie before serving with shaved chocolate for garnish if desired."
