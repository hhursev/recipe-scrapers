(It will be a little thick, but it should be fully melted.)\nRemove the pan from the heat and whisk for 1 minute.\nNext, whisk eggs, rest of the milk, and cornstarch together in a medium bowl then gradually whisk in 2 tablespoons of the melted chocolate at a time into the eggs until it is fully combined. (This will temper the eggs so that they don’t scramble when you put the pan back on the heat.)\nPour all the filling back into the saucepan and place it back over medium-low heat while you whisk continuously to prevent burning.\nUse a rubber spatula occasionally to scrape down the chocolate from the sides and to get into the corners so that they don’t burn.\nContinue whisking until the mixture reaches a thinner pudding texture and coats the back of a spoon.\nRemove the pan from the heat and continue whisking gently for 5 more minutes then pour it over the pie crust and LET THE PIE SIT AT ROOM TEMPERATURE FOR 1 HOUR TO COOL BEFORE MOVING TO THE REFRIGERATOR.\nCover tightly with plastic wrap then refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to 8 hours.\nRight before serving, whip the heavy cream and powdered sugar together in a medium bowl until stiff peaks form.\nSpread it all over the pie before serving with shaved chocolate for garnish if desired.",
