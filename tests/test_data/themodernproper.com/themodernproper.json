      "reviewBody": "I followed the directions to a tee but it seemed a little bland. I didn’t want to deviate from the spice ratio until I tried it once. Even my wife said the same thing. I might go times two on the nutmeg and allspice. I am going to sprinkle some on the leftovers and see if that makes a difference. With that all said, I will make again. My wife has eaten Swedish meatballs before but this was my first time."

I made this last night and oh my God was so good! \r\nI actually made it lactose-free using Silk dairy-free heavy whipping cream alternative. I was a little nervous it wouldn't take but I just added the broth and cream slowly. Made everything nice and thick. \r\nExcellent recipe! \r\nThank you"

My toddler also LOVES them. He's been eating this weekly since he was 10 months old. Thank you for this and so many great recipes!"
