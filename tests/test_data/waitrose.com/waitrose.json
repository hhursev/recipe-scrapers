  "description": "We make a fresh tea bread and muffins of the same flavour every day in the restaurant and shop kitchen. Many of our customers buy them for their children as they contain less added sugar than some other tea breads. The best bananas to use would be those slightly browning on the skin – not yellow ones. Use the best-quality bitter chocolate you can.",
