  "ingredients": [
    "1 pound Rigatoni (or paccheri, ziti, penne, etc)",
    "6 ounces bacon (chopped)",
    "1 large yellow onion (finely diced)",
    "1 medium head cabbage (chopped)",
    "1/2 cup dry white wine",
    "3 cups low-sodium chicken stock (divided)",
    "3/4 cup grated Parmigiano Reggiano (plus more for serving)",
    "salt and pepper (to taste)",
    "2 cup pasta water (will most likely not need all of it)",
    "1/2 cup minced flat-leaf Italian parsley",
    "2 tablespoons cold butter (cubed)"
  ],
  "instructions_list": [
    "Bring a large pot of salted water to boil.",
    "Heat a large pan to medium and saute the bacon until most of the fat has been rendered. Remove the bacon to a plate and set aside.",
    "Add the onion to the pan along with a pinch of salt and cook until softened. Add the cabbage and mix to coat. Add 1 cup of chicken stock and turn the heat to medium high. Cover with a tight fitting lid and cook for 10 minutes. Remove the lid and cook until the liquid evaporates. Add the wine and cook until it evaporates. Let the cabbage brown for a few minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.",
    "Meanwhile, begin cooking the pasta to 2 minutes less than al dente.",
    "Add the pasta to the pan along with the remaining 2 cups of stock and 1 cup of pasta water. Cook until al dente then remove the pan from the heat. Add 1/2 of the bacon back in with pasta.",
    "Mix in the cheese and parsley. Taste test and season with plenty of cracked black pepper and salt to taste. If the pasta is too dry, add a bit more of the reserved pasta water at a time until a creamy consitency is achieved. Whisk in the butter 1 cube at a time. Serve in bowls and top with the remaining bacon. Serve with more grated cheese. Enjoy!"
