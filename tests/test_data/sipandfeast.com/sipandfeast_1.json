    "For the steaks",
    "Combine the breadcrumbs, milk, and grated onion in a large bowl and let sit for 5 minutes.",
    "Add the remaining ingredients to the bowl and gently mix together. Form 4 equal-sized oval patties approximately 1-inch thick.",
    "Sear the steaks and make the gravy",
    "Heat a large cast-iron or heavy skillet to medium heat. Add the olive oil and sear the patties for 3-4 minutes per side or until well browned on both sides. Remove the patties to a plate and tent with foil to keep warm.",
    "Add the onions and mushrooms to the pan along with a pinch of salt. Saute until the mushrooms release their water then let them brown for a few minutes.",
    "Add the wine to the pan and turn the heat to high. With a wooden spoon scrape up all of the brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Cook until the wine almost entirely evaporates (2-3 minutes) then turn the heat down to medium.",
    "Add the butter to the pan. Once it melts add the flour and cook for 2 minutes or until golden.",
    "Slowly pour the stock into the pan while whisking. Turn the heat to medium-high and whisk until the gravy is smooth. Mix in the mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and thyme then turn the heat down to a simmer.",
    "Add the steaks to the pan and spoon the gravy on top of them. Simmer for 5-7 minutes, covered, flipping at halfway point. Once the steaks are cooked through, test the gravy and adjust salt and pepper to taste. Enjoy!"
