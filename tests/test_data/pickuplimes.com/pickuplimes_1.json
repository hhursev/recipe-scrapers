  "description": "This simple dressing with shallots is a quick and elegant way to elevate everyday salads. Thinly sliced shallots are softened in tangy white wine vinegar, then whisked with extra-virgin olive oil, maple syrup, and a touch of Dijon mustard for a perfectly balanced vinaigrette. It’s sweet, sharp, rich, and silky, plus it pairs especially well with lentil or grain-based bowls, or hearty greens like a green bean salad.",
