  "description": "This meal could go by another name: “A cured meat and umami bomb of flavor, all tangled with pasta.” But that's too long a name to go on the recipe card and besides, you already know what we mean when we say “prosciutto” and “mushrooms.” But this pasta also has a creamy lemon-y sauce, not to mention butter and cheese… now we're talking paragraphs, not meal titles.",
