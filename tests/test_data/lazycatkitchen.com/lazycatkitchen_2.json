    "Add 2 tbsp of olive oil to a medium, pre-heated heavy pan, next add diced onion and sautee on low heat until translucent. Next add in chopped garlic and sautee for a couple of minutes on low heat stirring frequently.",
    "Stir in a generous pinch of salt and dry spices: oregano, smoked paprika, cinnamon or cumin and sautee for 30 seconds.",
    "Next add in bay leaves and both cans of plum tomatoes one at a time - once in the pan, squash them gently with a potato masher before adding the second and squashing. Add a can full of water and increase the heat to medium.",
    "Simmer on medium heat, stirring every 15 minutes or so. Simmer until tomatoes have broken down fully and the sauce has thickened. You may need to add more water if the pan is looking dry and the tomatoes haven't yet fully broken down.",
    "Season with salt, pepper and sugar. Add drained chickpeas to the pan and cook for another 10 minutes or so. This sauce is best the day after it was made, but if serving straight away, fry your sausages in a separate pan.",
    "Remove the bay leaves, divide the stew between four bowls, top with chopped olives, crumbled cheese, fresh dill and a drizzle of chilli (or extra virgin olive oil) if you wish. Serve with your favourite bread."
