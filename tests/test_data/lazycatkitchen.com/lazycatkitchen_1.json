  "ingredients": [
    "200 g / 7 oz linguine or spaghetti (gluten-free if needed)",
    "2-3 tbsp / 30-45 ml olive oil",
    "2 garlic cloves, sliced finely",
    "1 red chilli* or ½-1 tsp chilli flakes, adjust to preference",
    "20 g / 2 tbsp capers in brine, roughly chopped if large",
    "12 black olives, I used Kalamata",
    "100 g / 3.5 oz cherry tomatoes (optional)",
    "400 g / 14 oz can of quality tomatoes",
    "salt and black pepper, to taste",
    "a handful of fresh parsley, chopped finely"
  ],
  "instructions_list": [
    "Heat up 2 tbsp of olive oil on low-medium heat. Add finely sliced garlic and finely chopped chilli (deseed it first if you want less spice).",
    "Allow the garlic to sizzle gently in the oil until it's golden, but be sure it doesn't turn brown as it will make the dish taste bitter - keep the flame low and stir frequently.",
    "Once garlic is ready, add capers blotted on a piece of paper towel. Carry on frying them off gently for a couple of minutes.",
    "Next, add halves olives and tomatoes - both canned and fresh cherry toms - to the pan. If you are using a can of whole plum tomatoes or tomato chunks, squash them down first using a potato masher or a fork - this will speed things up.",
    "Season with pepper and a generous pinch of salt, then increase the heat to medium and allow the sauce to thicken while you cook your pasta. Once reduced, taste and adjust the seasoning. Add a touch of sugar if the sauce is too acidic.",
    "While the sauce is bubbling away, cook your pasta until just shy of al dente. Drain, reserving about half a cup (120 ml) of pasta cooking water.",
    "Transfer drained pasta into the pan with the pasta. Use a splash of pasta cooking water if the sauce needs loosening up a bit.",
    "Divide between two (100 g / 3.5 oz of pasta per person) or three (just under 70 g / 2.5 oz pasta per person) plates. Serve immediately, with finely chopped parsley on top."
