  "title": "Easy Instant Pot Mac and Cheese",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 Tablespoon butter",
    "1/2 cup finely diced onion",
    "2 cloves minced garlic",
    "3 cups water",
    "12 oz dry elbow macaroni pasta",
    "1 teaspoon salt",
    "pepper to taste",
    "1 12 oz can evaporated milk (full fat)",
    "3 heaping cups shredded cheddar cheese (I prefer sharp cheddar)"
  ],
  "instructions_list": [
    "Turn Instant Pot to sauté and melt the butter. Add in the onions and cook until soft, about 2-3 minutes. Add in the garlic and cook for one additional minute, stirring constantly to prevent garlic from burning.",
    "Pour in the water, dry macaroni, salt, and pepper to taste. Stir everything together then place the lid on the Instant Pot and turn the valve to \"sealing.\" Cook over manual high pressure for 4 minutes.",
    "When the time is up, perform a quick release and flip the valve to \"venting\" to release the steam. Once the steam is completely released and the pin has dropped, open the lid and stir the noodles. Turn the pot to sauté again, and pour in the evaporated milk and half of the shredded cheese. Cook for about 5 minutes until thick and creamy. Stir very often to keep the noodles from sticking to the bottom of the pot.",
    "Hit \"cancel\" to turn off the heat, then add in the rest of the cheese. Stir well and serve. Enjoy!"
