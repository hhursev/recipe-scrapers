    "Press the dough evenly into the prepared pan. Bake for 15 minutes, then remove from oven (it will look slightly underbaked).",
    "In a large bowl, toss the apple slices with flour, sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg until evenly coated. Spread apple mixture in an even layer over the top of the crust.",
    "In a medium bowl, combine oats, brown sugar, cinnamon, and flour. Use a pastry cutter or fork to cut the butter into the the streusel ingredients until the mixture is crumbly.",
    "Sprinkle the streusel evenly over the top of the apples. Place bars in pre-heated oven and bake for 30–40 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the apples are tender.",
    "Remove from oven and cool completely in the pan on a wire rack. Once the bars are cool, lift out using parchment paper and cut into squares or bars with a sharp knife."
