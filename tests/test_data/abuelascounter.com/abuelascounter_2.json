    "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a 9*13 baking pan with parchment paper. You want some of the paper to hang off the sides. Then spray with oil.",
    "In a bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, salt and vanilla bean powder. When it’s all combined, add the softened butter. Press the butter into the flour mixture. The mixture should be crumbly.",
    "Dump the mixture into the baking pan and gently press it down. You can use the bottom of a glass or measuring cup to even everything out.",
    "Bake for 12-15 minutes until it is golden brown. Then set on a rack to cool.",
    "While the crust is cooling make the filling.",
    "In a bowl, mix together the eggs, brown sugar, maple syrup, corn starch, butter, vanilla powder, vanilla extract, salt. Beat with an electric mixer until the sugar is completely dissolved into the eggs. It will take a couple minutes.",
    "Add the pecans to the mixture. The pecans should be coated completely.",
    "Pour the mixture over the crust. Bake for 25 minutes or until it is completely set. You can stick a toothpick inside to be sure it’s ready.",
