  "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.\nSpread the bottom of your roasting pan with the sliced onions. Season the onions with 2 tablespoons of oil and salt and pepper.\nTime to Prep the Chicken: Remove the chicken giblets. Rinse the chicken inside and out under cold water. Pat the outside dry and put it in a roasting pan.\nWhisk all the ingredients into the olive oil until emulsified.\nSprinkle the chicken with a generous amount of salt and pepper on all sides. Season liberally. You even want to add some salt to the cavity of the chicken. Don’t be afraid.\nAdd the whole onion to the inside of the cavity. You can also add fresh herbs or bay leaves to the cavity.\nPour the marinade over the chicken. Marinate it overnight in the fridge or just for a few minutes.\nRoast the chicken for 30 minutes at 425 degrees then add ¼ cup of water to the bottom of the pan to be sure the onions don’t get too much color and drop the temperature to 350 degrees.\nRoast for another 50-60 minutes. The chicken will roast for a about 90 minutes total.\nThe chicken is ready once the skin is golden brown and the juices run completely clear when you cut with a knife. If you are using a meat thermometer it should read 160 degrees between the breast and thigh area. Once you pull the chicken out of the oven let it rest for 15 minutes then carve and serve.",
