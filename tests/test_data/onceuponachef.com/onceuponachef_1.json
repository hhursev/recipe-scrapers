  "title": "Pumpkin Bread",
  "ingredients": [
    "2 cups all-purpose flour, spooned into measuring cup and leveled-off",
    "½ teaspoon salt",
    "1 teaspoon baking soda",
    "½ teaspoon baking powder",
    "1 teaspoon ground cloves",
    "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon",
    "1 teaspoon ground nutmeg",
    "1½ sticks (¾ cup) unsalted butter, softened",
    "2 cups sugar",
    "2 large eggs",
    "1 (15-oz) can 100% pure pumpkin (I use Libby's)"
  ],
  "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 325°F and set an oven rack in the middle position. Generously grease two 8 x 4-inch loaf pans with butter and dust with flour (alternatively, use a baking spray with flour in it, such as Pam with Flour or Baker's Joy).\nIn a medium bowl, combine the flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder, cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Whisk until well combined; set aside.\nIn a large bowl of an electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar on medium speed until just blended. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Continue beating until very light and fluffy, a few minutes. Beat in the pumpkin. The mixture might look grainy and curdled at this point -- that's okay.\nAdd the flour mixture and mix on low speed until combined.\nTurn the batter into the prepared pans, dividing evenly, and bake for 65 – 75 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean. Let the loaves cool in the pans for about 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.\nFresh out of the oven, the loaves have a deliciously crisp crust. If they last beyond a day, you can toast individual slices to get the same fresh-baked effect.\nFreezer-Friendly Instructions: The bread can be frozen for up to 3 months. After it is completely cooled, wrap it securely in aluminum foil, freezer wrap or place in a freezer bag. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator before serving.",
