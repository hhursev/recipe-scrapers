  "instructions": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the corn, cover, and turn the heat down to low. Simmer for 10 minutes. Remove the corn from the water and let cool.\nMeanwhile, place the chopped red onions in a small bowl and cover with water. Let sit about ten minutes, then drain completely in a sieve and set aside.\nPlace the beans in a sieve; run under cold water to rinse well. Let drain completely and set aside.\nHolding the cooled corn upright in a large bowl, cut the kernels off the cob in strips. Add the beans, red onion, red bell pepper and cilantro.\nMake the dressing by combining all of the ingredients in a blender or mini food processor; process until smooth.\nPour the dressing over the salad and toss well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or, preferably, overnight.\nRight before serving, slice the avocado in half. Remove the pit; using a butter knife, cut a grid in each half. Holding the avocado halves over the salad, use a spoon to scoop out the diced flesh. Toss the salad gently, then taste and adjust seasoning if necessary (I usually add a squeeze of fresh lime to freshen it up). Garnish with a bit of fresh chopped cilantro if desired. Serve cold.",
