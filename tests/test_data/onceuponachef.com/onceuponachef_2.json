    "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the corn, cover, and turn the heat down to low. Simmer for 10 minutes. Remove the corn from the water and let cool.",
    "Meanwhile, place the chopped red onions in a small bowl and cover with water. Let sit about ten minutes, then drain completely in a sieve and set aside.",
    "Place the beans in a sieve; run under cold water to rinse well. Let drain completely and set aside.",
    "Holding the cooled corn upright in a large bowl, cut the kernels off the cob in strips. Add the beans, red onion, red bell pepper and cilantro.",
    "Make the dressing by combining all of the ingredients in a blender or mini food processor; process until smooth.",
    "Pour the dressing over the salad and toss well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or, preferably, overnight.",
    "Right before serving, slice the avocado in half. Remove the pit; using a butter knife, cut a grid in each half. Holding the avocado halves over the salad, use a spoon to scoop out the diced flesh. Toss the salad gently, then taste and adjust seasoning if necessary (I usually add a squeeze of fresh lime to freshen it up). Garnish with a bit of fresh chopped cilantro if desired. Serve cold."
