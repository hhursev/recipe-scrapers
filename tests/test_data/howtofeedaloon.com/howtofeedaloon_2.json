    "Make the Chili Paste",
    "Heat the oil in a large, sturdy skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add the chiles and garlic and stir to coat with the oil. Simmer in the oil for about 2 minutes. Use a slotted spoon or tongs to carefully remove the chiles and garlic and place them on a platter lined with paper towels.",
    "Pat the chiles and garlic dry and place them in a large pot. Add just enough water to cover the chiles. Bring to a simmer and cover. Simmer for 7 minutes, or until the chiles are very tender.",
    "Drain the chiles and garlic through a colander into a heatproof bowl, reserving the liquid.",
    "Transfer the chiles and garlic to a blender. Add the salt, bouillon cube, and 1 cup of the chile water. Purée for 1 minute, until very smooth. Allow the paste to cool down and then transfer to a jar with a tight-fitting lid. Refrigerate for up to 2 weeks.",
    "Make the Tacos al Pastor",
    "Place the pork shoulder in the freezer for 30 minutes (this makes slicing it easier).",
    "In a blender, add the pineapple juice, vinegar, oil, chile paste, achiote paste, brown sugar, garlic, oregano, cumin, pepper, cinnamon, cloves, and salt. Purée until smooth. Set aside.",
    "Remove the pork shoulder from the freezer and use a sharp knife to cut it into ¼-inch slices.",
    "Place the pork in a large dish and pour about three-quarters of the marinade over it. Turn the meat over and press the marinade into the pork. Cover and chill for up to 24 hours, preferably overnight. Add the remaining marinade/sauce to a container with a lid and refrigerate.",
    "Prepare your charcoal (or gas) grill to medium-high heat, creating a 2-zone (heat and no-heat) set-up.",
    "Cut the top and base off the pineapple. Cut two ½-inch slices. Cut the remaining pineapple into slices or chunks, cutting around the core.",
    "Press one pineapple slice down the skewer and then layer the marinated pork on the skewer. Top with the other pineapple slice.",
    "Place the skewer plate over the indirect heat and cover for 1 hour.",
    "After 1 hour, use kitchen shears (or a sharp knife) to cut away dark spots on the edges of the meat. Cover and cook for another 45 minutes.",
    "Add the pineapple slices and cook for another 15 minutes (the meat should cook for 2 hours). Add the extra sauce to a saucepan and gently warm it.",
    "Carefully remove the skewer plate and pineapple from the grill. Cut the pineapple into chunks and use a large, sharp knife to slice pieces of meat from the skewer.",
    "Serve at once with warmed corn tortillas, garnished with the grilled chopped pineapple, cilantro, onion, warmed sauce, and lime wedges."

  "description": "Grilled Tacos al Pastor is a true flavor explosion. Allow the pork to sit in the marinade for at least 12 hours for maximum flavor. If you don't have a skewer plate, you can simply grill the meat on your gas or charcoal grill. You can also roast the meat in the oven. The homemade chili paste can be made up to 2 weeks in advance.",
