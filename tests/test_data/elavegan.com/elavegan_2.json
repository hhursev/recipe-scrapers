    "I recommend measuring the ingredients in grams on a kitchen scale. Check the video in the post for visual instructions.",
    "Start by lining a baking dish with parchment paper with an overhang on all sides (for easy removal). My pan measures 6×9 inches (ca. 15x23 cm).",
    "Make the streusel topping: Add all dry ingredients for the streusel to a bowl, stir with a whisk, then add the wet ingredients. Use your fingers to combine everything until the mixture is slightly crumbly. Set aside and preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (ca. 180 °C).",
    "Add all dry cake ingredients into a large mixing bowl and stir with a whisk. You could also add the dry ingredients to a food processor and blend for a couple of seconds.",
    "Next, add the wet cake ingredients and stir with a whisk. You can also use a hand mixer.",
    "Assemble: Pour about half of the batter into the lined baking dish. Then add half of the cinnamon streusel. Pour the remaining batter on top of the streusel and finally add the remaining streusel.",
    "Bake for about 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the crumb cake comes out almost clean (it can be crumbly but shouldn't be wet). The baking time can be a few minutes less or more, depending on your oven and the size of the pan. Let cool completely, then drizzle with icing (optional). Check the recipe notes below for the icing. Enjoy!"
