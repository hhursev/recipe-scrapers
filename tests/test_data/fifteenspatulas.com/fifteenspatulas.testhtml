<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Creme Brulee is often thought of as restaurant food, but it&#8217;s actually one of the easiest desserts you can make at home, with as few as 3 simple ingredients. This classic creamy custard can be customized in many different flavors, and I also share how you can caramelize the top without a torch.&nbsp;</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img width="640" height="959" decoding="async" src="https://www.fifteenspatulas.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Orange-Creme-Brulee-Fifteen-Spatulas-1-640x959.jpg" alt="Creme Brulee - in White Ramekin with Spoon Showing Caramelized Top" class="wp-image-33031"/></figure>



<p>Few desserts can beat out the luscious creaminess that is creme brulee. Only <a href="https://www.fifteenspatulas.com/rice-pudding/">Rice Pudding</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fifteenspatulas.com/mascarpone-peanut-butter-pie-with-cocoa-crust/">Peanut Butter Pie</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fifteenspatulas.com/framboise-panna-cotta-with-raspberry-gelee/">Panna Cotta,</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fifteenspatulas.com/baklava/">Baklava</a>&nbsp;can compete as some of my other favorite holy-grail desserts. </p>



<p>Besides being wildly delicious, creme brulee is an easy dessert that&#8217;s make-ahead friendly.&nbsp;It&#8217;s one of the options I go to for dinner parties, because I can keep the custards in the fridge until they&#8217;re ready to serve, and torch them right before serving. </p>



<p>And bonus, people love watching creme brulee get torched, and a few brave ones will even do their own themselves!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" width="640" height="427" src="https://www.fifteenspatulas.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Orange-Creme-Brulee-Fifteen-Spatulas-3-640x427.jpg" alt="Orange Creme Brulee in White Ramekin on Wooden Board" class="wp-image-33033"/></figure>



<p>There are really only three creme brulee ingredients that you need: heavy whipping cream, egg yolks, and sugar. But personally, I love infusing various flavors into the custard. </p>



<p>For the simplest option, add vanilla extract or a whole vanilla bean to the dairy. But feel free to do some longer infusions of whatever ingredient you&#8217;d like, whether it&#8217;s citrus, lavender, coffee, or more unusual flavor infusions like basil or lemongrass (don&#8217;t knock it &#8217;til you&#8217;ve tried it).</p>



<span id="more-824"></span>



<p>Orange Creme Brulee happens to be one of my favorite flavor infusions after dining out at a fancy restaurant called Va de Vi in the East Bay of California. Their creme brulee bursted with orange flavor, but I noticed there was no orange zest actually visible. </p>



<p>The waitress told me they infuse the zest into the cream, and I set out to recreate it at home. The flavor is amazing! I&#8217;ll share all the flavor options below, or you can keep it simple with the classic cream, egg yolks, and sugar.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group has-lightblue-background-color has-background is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tips-for-best-results">Tips for Best Results</h2>



<p><strong>Use premium heavy cream</strong> &#8211; It is astonishing how different dairy can taste among the various brands.  Some dairy products have no flavor, while others have that quintessential sweet cream fatty dairy flavor. I&#8217;ve noticed that organic dairy products tend to have more flavor. </p>



<p><strong>Bake in a water bath</strong> &#8211; It&#8217;s an extra step, but it is absolutely essential to bake the custards in a water bath in order to get the best results. The water bath keeps the temperature of the custards from rising too quickly, ensuring that you get a silky smooth texture instead of curdled eggs.</p>



<p><strong>Allow plenty of time to chill </strong>&#8211; Warm creme brulee really isn&#8217;t very enjoyable. You will need to allow plenty of time for the ramekins to chill in the fridge, for the proper texture and also for the most enjoyable eating experience. This takes a minimum of 4-6 hours.</p>
</div></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-step-by-step-overview">Step by Step Overview:</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;d like to infuse your creme brulee with flavorings like citrus zest or lavender, begin with this optional step. </p>



<p>Combine heavy cream and the flavoring of choice in a small saucepan (see suggestions below), and let it sit in the fridge for 2 hours. Skip this step if you&#8217;re not doing any infusion.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-flavor-ideas">Flavor Ideas</h2>



<p>There are so many creme brulee flavors you can do that are truly incredible. Because there&#8217;s a high fat content in this dessert, it really allows the flavors and aromas to bloom on the palate. Here are some of my favorite flavor ideas.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Lemongrass</strong> &#8211; Whack a 2&#8243; piece with a knife to bruise lightly, then steep in the cream for 2 hours.</li>



<li><strong>Lavender</strong> &#8211; Steep 1 teaspoon of dried lavender in the cream for 2 hours.</li>



<li><strong>Citrus</strong> &#8211; Instead of steeping 2 teaspoons of orange zest in the cream, you could swap in equal amounts of lemon zest, lime zest, meyer lemon zest, or grapefruit zest.</li>



<li><strong>Vanilla</strong> &#8211; Add 1 tsp vanilla extract after mixing the egg yolks and hot cream together, or scrape the insides of a vanilla bean pod into the cream and let steep for 2 hours.</li>



<li><strong>Coffee</strong> &#8211; Add 1 tsp coffee extract after mixing the egg yolks and hot cream together. </li>



<li><strong>Teas </strong>&#8211; Add 1 tea bag of earl gray, chai tea, or green tea to the cream and steep for 2 hours.</li>
</ul>
</div></div>



<p>In a medium bowl, combine egg yolks with granulated sugar:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="427" src="https://www.fifteenspatulas.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Orange-Creme-Brulee-Fifteen-Spatulas-5-640x427.jpg" alt="Creme Brulee Ingredients - In Stainless Steel Bowl with Egg Yolks and Sugar" class="wp-image-33035"/></figure>



<p>Whisk together for about 1 minute, until the two ingredients are blended well. Then, set the egg mixture aside.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="427" src="https://www.fifteenspatulas.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Orange-Creme-Brulee-Fifteen-Spatulas-6-640x427.jpg" alt="Whisked Egg Yolks and Sugar in Bowl" class="wp-image-33036"/></figure>



<p>Place the heavy cream in a medium saucepan over medium high heat, and cook until the mixture reaches 180F:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="427" src="https://www.fifteenspatulas.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Orange-Creme-Brulee-Fifteen-Spatulas-7-640x427.jpg" alt="Scalded Cream in Saucepan with Thermometer Verifying" class="wp-image-33037"/></figure>



<p>Be careful not to take it all the way to a boil. Using a <a href="https://amzn.to/2SdTo1X" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored" class="broken_link">thermometer</a> (affiliate) is best, but if you don&#8217;t have one, you&#8217;ll know it&#8217;s at proper scalding temperature when bubbles are beginning to form on the side of the pan, but it&#8217;s not yet boiling:</p>

<p>While whisking, slowly dribble the hot cream mixture into the whisked egg yolks and sugar, over the course of about a minute:</p>

<p>We are tempering the mixture and raising the egg temperature very slowly, so the egg doesn&#8217;t scramble and coagulate.</p>



<p>Just to be sure there are no firm egg bits (and to strain out the orange zest), pour the custard through a fine mesh strainer or sieve:</p>

<p>In this recipe, I divide the creamy vanilla custard evenly between six 4-ounce ramekins. However, you could also do four 6-ounce ramekins. You may need an extra 5 minutes or so of baking time. The target temperature for doneness is about 165F.</p>



<p>You can also use the really shallow ramekins with the fluted edges, but you&#8217;ll need to check for doneness much earlier. Again, check the temperature using a thermomer if you are not comfortable judging by the jiggle.</p>
</div></div>



<p>Evenly divide the custard into six 4-ounce ramekins, then place the ramekins into a 9&#215;13 baking dish or metal pan. Fill the larger pan with boiling water until the water comes halfway up the sides of the ramekins:</p>

<p>A small tip, but if you want extra protection from the ramekins sliding around, place a few layers of paper towel underneath before adding the water.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-does-the-water-bath-do">What does the water bath do?</h2>



<p>Creme brulee is a custard, and with pretty much any custard, you want to cook it slowly, and at a fairly low temperature. Water will never get hotter than 212F, so it does a good job of ensuring that your creme brulee doesn’t overcook and turn into scrambled eggs. The hot water bath will ultimately give you the most silky smooth, creamy end result.</p>
</div></div>



<p>Bake the creme brulee in a 300F preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, until they only jiggle slightly when shaken, and have set:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="427" src="https://www.fifteenspatulas.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Orange-Creme-Brulee-Fifteen-Spatulas-12-640x427.jpg" alt="Citrus Creme Brulee Fully Cooked Without Curdling in Ramekins" class="wp-image-33042"/></figure>



<p>Take the ramekins out of the water bath and let them cool to room temperature, ideally set on a wire rack. Then cover the tops with plastic wrap and chill completely in the fridge. This will take at least 4-6 hours to completely chill through to the middle.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group has-lightblue-background-color has-background is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-make-ahead-option">Make-ahead Option</h2>



<p>At this point in the recipe, you can store the creme brulee in the fridge for up to 4 days, untorched. Then when you&#8217;re ready to serve, simply take the ramekins out of the fridge, add the sugar to the top, and caramelize.</p>
</div></div>



<p>When you&#8217;re ready to torch and serve the creme brulee, add 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar to the top of the custard in each ramekin, giving it a shake side-to-side to evenly spread the granules out:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="427" src="https://www.fifteenspatulas.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Orange-Creme-Brulee-Fifteen-Spatulas-13-640x427.jpg" alt="Adding Granulated Sugar for Creme Brulee Topping" class="wp-image-33043"/></figure>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-options-for-browning-the-top">Options for Browning the Top</h2>



<p>You have two choices for browning the sugar topping: Using a <a href="https://amzn.to/2XBhVnv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">handheld kitchen torch (affiliate)</a>, or using your oven&#8217;s broiler.</p>



<p>While both will work, my recommendation is to use a blow torch, for a few reasons. It will give you the most even browning on top, and you won&#8217;t risk overheating the custard while you&#8217;re torching. </p>



<p>Oven broilers vary, and I&#8217;ve noticed with mine that by the time I get proper browning on top, the broiler has heated the creme brulee beneath, and it loses a little bit of its chill and firm texture (and becomes a bit soupy just underneath the sugar). </p>



<p>To get around this a little bit, you can broil the top, then put the custards back into the fridge to firm up again. Using a superfine sugar also helps. </p>
</div></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-comparing-torched-vs-broiled-tops">Comparing Torched vs Broiled Tops</h2>



<p>For a visual comparison, I browned a few of the ramekins using a torch, and a few using my oven&#8217;s broiler. </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what the caramelized sugar crust looks like with the oven broiler version:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="427" src="https://www.fifteenspatulas.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Orange-Creme-Brulee-Fifteen-Spatulas-14-640x427.jpg" alt="Creme Brulee Without a Torch - Broiled in the Oven to Caramelize Top" class="wp-image-33044"/></figure>



<p>And here&#8217;s what the burnt sugar from the torched version looks like:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="959" src="https://www.fifteenspatulas.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Orange-Creme-Brulee-Fifteen-Spatulas-2-640x959.jpg" alt="Creme Brulee Recipe - Served in White Ramekins with Orange Wedge " class="wp-image-33032"/></figure>



<p>You can see that using a handheld torch gives you caramelization that&#8217;s a bit more even, and it also keeps the custard underneath cool so you can serve right away. </p>



<p>But as I said, if you use the broiler to caramelize the sugar, you can just put the custards back into the fridge to firm it up again, for about an hour. The sugar topping will stay crunchy, though keep in mind that if it sits longer than that, the topping will likely soften as humidity and moisture are absorbed from the air.</p>

<p>A proper crème brûlée is best enjoyed chilled, and it should have a luscious, creamy, pudding-like texture to it, with the contrasting crunch of the sugar on top. I love serving this classic French dessert for special occasions like Valentine&#8217;s day or birthdays.</p>



<p>This dessert certainly stands on its own, but if you&#8217;d like to pair it with a few other desserts for the table, I recommend small, relatively neutral and complementary nibbles like <a href="https://www.fifteenspatulas.com/quick-stovetop-candied-pecans/">Candied Pecans</a>, <a href="https://www.fifteenspatulas.com/butter-swirl-shortbread-cookies/">Shortbread Cookies</a>, or <a href="https://www.fifteenspatulas.com/chocolate-covered-strawberries/">Chocolate Covered Strawberries</a>.</p>

<p>Creme Brulee, also called burnt cream, is a good gluten-free option for dessert. You can also try using a sugar-alternative to make it keto-friendly.

Then place the creme brulees on a sheet pan, and set them underneath the broiler for a minute or two, watching very closely, until the top has browned. Note that this method is not as good as using a torch, since often times oven broilers are not strong enough to quickly brown the top without melting the custard underneath too. If the custard melts, refrigerate the creme brulee for an hour to chill the filling again.</p> </div> </div>

Set the oven rack as close as possible to the broiler, and preheat to high. Place the ramekins on a sheet pan, and broil for 1-2 minutes, until the top caramelizes, making sure you keep your eye on the browning (it&#39;s easier to burn the sugar using the broiler). If your oven&#39;s broiler isn&#39;t strong enough to caramelize the sugar without heating the filling, then place the ramekins back into the fridge for an hour before serving, to re-firm the custard. Serve and enjoy!</span></div></li></ul></div></div>

See the blog post for more flavor ideas. If skipping the orange or other flavorings, no steeping time is needed and you should start the recipe with step 2.</span><div class="wprm-spacer"></div>
<span style="display: block;"><strong>Storing leftovers:</strong> Keep covered in the fridge for up to 4 days.</span><div class="wprm-spacer"></div>
<span style="display: block;"><strong>Freezing:</strong> Freeze for up to 3 months, but know that there will likely be a bit of weeping liquid when you thaw it, and slight textural differences. To thaw, place in the refrigerator overnight.</span><div class="wprm-spacer"></div>
<span style="display: block;"><strong>Make-ahead:</strong> Make the recipe all the way through fully baking the custards. Then let cool and keep in the fridge, untorched, for up to 4 days. When you’re ready to serve, simply take the custards out of the fridge, add the sugar to the top, and caramelize.</span></div></div>

	        <div class="comment-content"><p>Hello,  I really want to try your recipe, but the ingredient volumes are confusing.<br />
It seems that, when switching from US to metric, everything converts except the egg yolks.<br />
The US volume is 5 yolks, but the metric volume is only 1 yolk.<br />
I&#8217;m reluctant to try the recipe because it&#8217;s not clear exactly what is intended.<br />
Please will you advise as I&#8217;m having guests this weekend and really want to do this.<br />
Thanks.</p>

	        <div class="comment-content"><p>I pay for a recipe plugin that converts to metric, and it is not checked by me manually because I don&#8217;t have experience with metric. It&#8217;s supposed to be pretty accurate but sounds like there is an issue here. I will send it to them. If you really need metric measurements I would probably find another recipe just to be safe.</p>
