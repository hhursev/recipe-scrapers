    "Baker's Schedule",
    "Overnight Option",
    "Make the dough in the evening and let rise overnight. The following morning, roll, cut and shape the dough. Rest for 1-2 hours (second rise) before baking.",
    "As an alternative, after resting for 1 hour, cover the dough and chill until ready to use. Rest at room temperature before baking. The dough should be plump and puffy before baking.",
    "Make-Ahead Option (Freeze): Place the cut & shaped cinnamon rolls into a parchment lined 9-inch springform pan. Cover with two layers of plastic wrap. Freeze until ready to use. The night before baking, remove the old plastic wrap and replace with fresh wrap (this prevents any condensation from dripping onto the rolls). Defrost overnight, about 10-12 hrs. at room temperature, approximately 67 F. Bake the following morning as directed.",
    "Make the Dough",
    "In the evening: Combine the melted butter and milk in a small bowl. Cool slightly before using.",
    "Add the egg, sourdough starter, and sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix to combine. With the machine running, slowly pour in the milk mixture. Add the flour and salt. Continue mixing until a rough, sticky dough forms, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Cover with a damp towel and let rest for 30 minutes.",
    "After the dough has rested, switch to the dough hook. Knead on medium-low speed for 6-8 minutes (I use #2 or #3 on my stand mixer). The dough should feel soft, supple and pull away from the sides of the bowl when ready. If it’s too sticky add a small bit of flour.",
    "Bulk Rise",
    "Transfer the dough to a medium-size bowl coated in butter. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise overnight until double in size, about 8-12 + hrs. @ 67-68 F, depending on temperature.",
    "Stretch and Fold the Dough (optional step): about 30 minutes- 1 hr. into the bulk rise stretch and fold the dough: grab a portion of the dough and stretch it upward. Fold it over toward the center of the bowl. Give the bowl a 1/4 turn; stretch and fold the dough again. Continue this technique until you’ve come full circle around the bowl (4 folds total). For video guidance, click here. This optional step will increase the overall volume of the rolls and aerate the dough.",
    "Roll the Dough",
    "In the morning: Line a 9-inch springform pan with parchment paper. I like to scrunch the paper into a ball first, open it up, and then line the inside with enough excess to hang over the sides for easy removal. It tends to fit better this way.",
    "Lightly oil and flour your countertop to prevent sticking. Coax the dough out of the bowl. Gently pat into a rough rectangle. Let rest for 10 minutes for easier rolling.",
    "Dust the dough (and your rolling pin) with flour. Roll the dough into a 16 x 12-ish rectangle using a tape measure for accuracy. If the dough resists, let rest for 5-10 minutes and try again.",
    "Make the Cinnamon-Sugar Filling",
    "If using the softened butter variation (listed in the notes above): add 84 g (6 tbsp) softened butter to a small bowl. Mix with the sugar, cinnamon and flour. With an offset spatula, spread onto the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edges.",
    "If using the melted butter version: brush the entire surface of the dough, including the top, bottom and sides with 28 g (2 tbsp) melted butter. Use all of it. Combine the sugar, cinnamon and flour in a bowl. Sprinkle the mixture onto the dough leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edges. Smooth it out with your hands until it looks wet and sandy.",
    "Shape & Cut the Dough",
    "Starting on the long side of the dough (16-inch), roll it into a log pressing down gently as you go. Take your time with this step. The log needs to be tight so the swirls stay in tact. You should end up seam side down. TIP: if the dough starts to get sticky from the heat of your hands, lightly oil or flour your fingertips, take a deep breath and try again.",
    "Cut the dough into 2-inch sections using a oiled knife or bench scraper. I lightly “mark” the dough first to make sure each piece is roughly the same size.",
    "Second Rise",
    "Place the rolls into the lined pan and let rest for 1- 2 hours, or until the dough puffs up. Alternatively, if you’d like to chill or freeze the rolls, please refer to the “Make-Ahead” option in the Baker’s Schedule at the top of this recipe.",
    "Bake the Cinnamon Rolls",
    "Preheat oven to 350 F. Bake the dough onto the center rack and bake for 35-40 minutes (check at the 30 minute mark). The tops should turn light golden brown when ready.",
    "Remove from the oven and cool in the pan for 15 minutes. This helps the butter to absorb back into the dough. Then lift up the rolls, while still on the parchment paper, and transfer to a wire rack.",
    "Make the Glaze",
    "While the rolls are baking or cooling make the glaze. Add softened butter, whipped cream cheese and sifted powdered sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer. Beat until smooth, thinning out the consistency with a little milk as needed. The ingredients must be soft and at room temperature for best results.",
    "To serve, top the rolls with some of the glaze or lightly dust with powdered sugar. These rolls are best enjoyed slightly warm on the same day they are baked."

I spaced out and forgot to use all purpose because I fed my starter too. Did not disappoint. Moisture, texture, crumb was on point! I only used 1/4 c powder sugar. Husband thought it could of been sweeter. But to me.. they are perfect!! They def boosted my confidence to continue making enriched dough."

After the rise I then rolled out, put in room temp butter,cinnamon and dark brown sugar mix, rolled into from and wrapped tight in plastic wrap and popped in the fridge overnight. Pulled them out at 5:30am, cut them to shape, put in my greased tin and let them rise beside the warming oven until 6:30 when they get all big and fluffy. Then I pour about a cup of heavy whipping cream all around the sides and over the top of the rolls. My oven runs on the hotter side so mine go in at 360° for 18 minutes. \r\nThey are the best flipping cinnamon rolls I have ever made or had!"

I read every comment posted before I attempt a recipe.  I followed another person's comment about pouring 1/2 cup of heavy cream on the rolls before baking (as she said her grandmother always did that).  I will continue to this, as the rolls were so moist and flavorful (and grandmothers have years of tried and true recipes, right? :)  \r\n\r\nI was gifted sourdough starter from a friend (that had been in his family for many years).  I was worried I would destroy this gift, as I live north of the Arctic Circle, and ingredients in our village are hard to come by.  My best discovery has been your recipes!  Everything I have made (sourdough sandwich bread, pancakes, bagels, sourdough onion rings, and discard crackers) turned out perfectly.

The filling leaked to the bottom quite a bit on my first bake so the next time I added a tiny amount of flour which helped. However, the leaky filling essentially turned into the gooey caramel on the bottom which was delightful, so the flour addition really wasn’t necessary for taste purposes. \r\nI also love how the recipe has weights and measurements listed. Thank you, sweet angel, for writing the recipe for anyone to easily follow. I will continue making these over and over!"
