  "ingredients": [
    "½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened (can use salted)",
    "½ cup creamy peanut butter",
    "¾ cup granulated sugar (divided use)",
    "½ cup light brown sugar, packed",
    "3 Tablespoons whole milk",
    "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
    "1 ½ cup all purpose flour",
    "1 teaspoon baking soda",
    "½ teaspoon baking powder",

  "instructions_list": [
    "Preheat the oven to 375℉ and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.",
    "In a bowl, cream together ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened, ½ cup creamy peanut butter, ½ cup white granulated sugar and ½ cup light brown sugar, packed together (using a stand mixer or electric hand mixer)",
    "Then stir in 3 Tablespoons whole milk and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.",
    "Add 1 ½ cup all purpose flour, 1 teaspoon baking soda and ½ teaspoon baking powder and stir together to make a dough.",
    "Roll the dough into 1 Tablespoon sized balls. This is easiest if you have a spring loaded cookie scoop.",
    "Then add the rest of the sugar (1/4 cup) to a small bowl and roll the balls in the sugar one at a time.",
    "Place cookies on your parchment lined baking sheet, evenly spaced, and bake for about 10 minutes.NOTE: This will need to be done in batches. It is best to only bake one tray at a time.",
    "While the cookies are baking, unwrap the Hershey's kisses if they are not already unwrapped, and as soon as the cookies come out of the oven, place one kiss in the center of each cookie and slightly press down. NOTE: The kisses need to be put on top of the cookies as soon as they are out of the oven so they will stick.",
    "Repeat steps 7 and 8 with the rest of the dough and allow to cool before enjoying."
