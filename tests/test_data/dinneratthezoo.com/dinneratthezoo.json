  "ingredients": [
    "1 1/4 pounds large sea scallops",
    "1/4 cup olive oil",
    "2 tablespoons lemon juice",
    "1 teaspoon kosher salt",
    "1/4 teaspoon black pepper",
    "1 teaspoon Italian seasoning",
    "2 teaspoons minced garlic",
    "1 tablespoon chopped parsley",
    "lemon wedges for serving"
  ],
  "instructions": "Place the olive oil, lemon juice, salt, pepper, Italian seasoning and garlic in a large bowl or resealable plastic bag. Stir to combine the ingredients.\nAdd the scallops to the bag or bowl. Toss to coat evenly with the marinade. Seal the bag or cover the bowl.\nRefrigerate and marinate for at least 15 minutes or up to 2 hours. You don't want to marinate for longer than that, as the acid in the lemon juice will start to cook the scallops.\nThread the scallops onto skewers. This is optional, if you have very large scallops you can skip the skewers and toss them directly onto the grill.\nHeat an outdoor grill or indoor grill pan over medium high heat.\nPlace the skewers or loose scallops on the grill. Cook for 1-2 minutes on each side or until scallops are firm and opaque.\nSprinkle with parsley and serve with lemon wedges.",
