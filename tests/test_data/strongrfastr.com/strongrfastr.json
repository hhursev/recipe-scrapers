Sprinkle taco seasoning, cayenne, cumin, and some salt over the mixture, and stir to combine. Cover the cooker, set on Low, and cook until chicken is very tender and the mixture has thickened, 8 to 10 hours.\nAfter its finished cooking, remove the chicken breasts and shred them with two forks. Return the shredded chicken to the stew and stir.\nMix a few tablespoons of stew liquid with cream cheese in a bowl, stir until smooth, and mix the cream cheese into the cooker to make a creamy sauce. Continue to cook for 15 minutes, then serve.",
