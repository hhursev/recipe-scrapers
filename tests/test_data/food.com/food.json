  "description": "This is a variation on my family's favorite chicken soup that I have already posted here. Lots of carrots and parsnips give it more of a sweet savor. The parsley actually balances the sweetness, though. To balance this effect, use the optional parsley, which is just slightly bitter. Sometimes I also add a diced turnip if I have one. For the noodles, I like to use tagliolini nests, which you can usually find in the imported pasta section. I prefer a thin noodle for this soup, but you can certainly use whatever is your preference.",
