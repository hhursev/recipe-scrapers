  "title": "Homemade Sriracha Sauce",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 3/4 pounds red jalapeño peppers (stems removed and halved lengthwise)",
    "3 garlic cloves",
    "2 tablespoons garlic powder ((optional))",
    "2 tablespoons granulated sugar (plus more as needed)",
    "1 tablespoon light brown sugar",
    "1 tablespoon kosher salt (plus more as needed)",
    "1/2 cup distilled white vinegar (plus more as needed)",
    "Water (as needed)"
  ],
  "instructions_list": [
    "Process",
    "To make the Sriracha, in the bowl of a food processor, combine the peppers, garlic, garlic powder, if desired, sugars, and salt. Pulse until a coarse purée forms.",
    "Ferment",
    "Transfer to a glass jar, seal, and store at room temperature for 7 days, stirring daily. (It may get a little fizzy; that's to be expected.)",
    "Simmer",
    "After 1 week, pour the chile mixture into a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the vinegar and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer gently for 5 minutes. [Editor's note: If you'd like to preserve the gut-friendly bacteria that has been brewing in your hot sauce, skip the simmering step and purée the pepper mixture and vinegar together in the next step.]",
    "Cool",
    "Let the mixture cool and then purée it in a food processor for 2 to 3 minutes, until a smooth, uniform paste forms. If the mixture is too thick to blend properly, add a small amount of water.",
    "Strain",
    "Pass the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer. Press on the solids with the back of a spoon to squeeze out every last bit of goodness you’ve been waiting a week to get.",
    "Season",
    "Taste and adjust the seasoning and consistency of the final sauce, adding additional vinegar, water, salt, granulated sugar, or garlic powder to suit your taste. Transfer to a glass jar, close the lid tightly, and refrigerate for up to 6 months."

Amazing recipe and still making it after all these growing seasons! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us!"

      "reviewBody": "Loved this recipe— I’ve made it twice now. Here are a couple of my notes that I hope can help future cooks: \r\n\r\nWhile the recipe doesn’t explicitly say when to add the water, I did so during the first step, just enough that my blender would have enough liquid to blend the peppers up. \r\n\r\nAlso, make sure you store it in a jar with extra room at the top to allow for the inevitable swelling of the ingredients as they start to ferment (I learned my lesson after the first batch). \r\n\r\nAfter sieving out the sauce, I reserved the paste and have it in a jar in the fridge, spooning some here and there into recipes like soup, curries, quiche… anywhere you want a little extra spice. It’s delicious, and no waste!\r\n\r\nI’m in EU and the sriracha shortage is real here. We have one sacred bottle of the classic rooster brand, an off-brand, and now this homemade sauce. Doing a blind taste-test, this one won out for me and it’s also significantly spicier than even the rooster one. That obviously is just subject to which chilies you use. I suppose you could “dilute” a batch with red bell peppers if you wanted a milder version while keeping the consistency the same. \r\n\r\nAll in all I’ll continue to make this every couple months! It’s not much work and yields a great flavor. Plus a really cute gift for the sriracha lover in your life:)"
