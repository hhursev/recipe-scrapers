  "title": "Homemade Sriracha Sauce",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 3/4 pounds red jalapeño peppers (stems removed and halved lengthwise)",
    "3 garlic cloves",
    "2 tablespoons garlic powder ((optional))",
    "2 tablespoons granulated sugar (plus more as needed)",
    "1 tablespoon light brown sugar",
    "1 tablespoon kosher salt (plus more as needed)",
    "1/2 cup distilled white vinegar (plus more as needed)",
    "Water (as needed)"
  ],
  "instructions_list": [
    "Process",
    "To make the Sriracha, in the bowl of a food processor, combine the peppers, garlic, garlic powder, if desired, sugars, and salt. Pulse until a coarse purée forms.",
    "Ferment",
    "Transfer to a glass jar, seal, and store at room temperature for 7 days, stirring daily. (It may get a little fizzy; that's to be expected.)",
    "Simmer",
    "After 1 week, pour the chile mixture into a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the vinegar and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer gently for 5 minutes. [Editor's note: If you'd like to preserve the gut-friendly bacteria that has been brewing in your hot sauce, skip the simmering step and purée the pepper mixture and vinegar together in the next step.]",
    "Cool",
    "Let the mixture cool and then purée it in a food processor for 2 to 3 minutes, until a smooth, uniform paste forms. If the mixture is too thick to blend properly, add a small amount of water.",
    "Strain",
    "Pass the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer. Press on the solids with the back of a spoon to squeeze out every last bit of goodness you’ve been waiting a week to get.",
    "Season",
    "Taste and adjust the seasoning and consistency of the final sauce, adding additional vinegar, water, salt, granulated sugar, or garlic powder to suit your taste. Transfer to a glass jar, close the lid tightly, and refrigerate for up to 6 months."
