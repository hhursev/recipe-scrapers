  "instructions_list": [
    "First of all, make your mousse. In a small, high powered blender, tip in the tofu and the melted chocolate. Simply blend until a smooth, silky texture. I like to scoop this into a piping bag to make things a little less messy.",
    "Pipe or scoop your chocolate mix into your serving bowls or dishes. I'd recommend leaving this for atleast 2-3 hours in the fridge, but it's also great to leave overnight as a make-ahead dessert!",
    "Preheat the oven to 190ºc fan/210ºc/375ºf. Tip all of the sesame seeds onto a baking tray and toast in the oven for 10 minutes. While the seeds are in the oven, tip the golden syrup, butter, caster sugar and miso into a saucepan. Line another baking tray with parchment paper.",
    "Bring the saucepan to a bubble, stirring to make sure everything is combined, then tip in the warm sesame seeds. Stir and add a pinch of flaky salt. Pour onto the parchment lined tray and spread out as flat as possible.",
    "Place the tray into the oven for 30-35 minutes, until the brittle is a dark golden brown and no longer bubbling. DO NOT TOUCH IT!! It'll stick to you and that's just not good.",
    "Leave the brittle to cool completely before breaking up into shards. Decorate the top of your mousse with another sprinkle of salt, and plenty of the sesame brittle shards."
