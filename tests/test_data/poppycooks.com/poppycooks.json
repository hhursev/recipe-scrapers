        "4 maris piper potatoes, peeled and cut into equal sized chunks",
        "100ml vegetable oil",

    ],
    "instructions_list": [
        "Get you potatoes into cold salted water and boil for 10-15 minutes until falling off the tip of the knife. You don't want them too mushy as they won't hold their shape.",
        "Drain off the potatoes and leave to steam dry in the colander with a tea towel over for a further 10-15 minutes. This makes them extra fluffy!",
        "Preheat the oven to 220°C Fan/475°F/Gas Mark 9 and get the oil into a baking tray and get it into the oven to get hot.",
        "Once the potatoes are ready, give them a good toss in the tray to fluff them up and then carefully pour into the hot tray with the oil.",
        "Cook for 20 minutes then remove from the oven. Turn the heat down to 180°C Fan/400°F/Gas Mark 6.",
        "Give the potatoes a turn and return to the oven for a further 15 minutes. You may need less/more time so keep an eye out.",
        "Once golden and crunch, they are ready to go! Sprinkle with a little more salt and enjoy the ultimate roasties!"
