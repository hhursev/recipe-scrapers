  "title": "Caputo Fioreglut Pizza Recipe",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 1/8 cups Caputo Fioreglut gluten free flour",
    "1 teaspoon instant yeast",
    "3/4 teaspoon granulated sugar",
    "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt",
    "5 1/4 ounces warm water",
    "1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil (plus more for handling and brushing)",
    "Your favorite pizza toppings ((sauce, shredded or sliced mozzarella cheese))"

  "instructions": "To make the pizza dough.\nIn the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, place the flour, yeast, and sugar. Whisk to combine with a separate, handheld whisk. Add the salt, and whisk again to combine well.\nAdd the water and olive oil, and mix very slowly until the flour is absorbed into the liquid. The mixture will be lumpy\nRaise the mixer to medium-high speed in your stand mixer until the dough becomes sticky and smooth (about 3 minutes).\nOil a medium-size bowl, and scrape the pizza dough into the bowl.\nUsing very well-oiled hands, loosely shape the dough into a round.\nCover the bowl tightly with plastic and place in a draft-free location until nearly doubled in size. That will take longer in cool, dry environments and less time in warm, moist places.\nTo bake the pizza.\nWhen you’re ready to make the pizza, place a pizza stone or overturned rimmed baking sheet in the oven and preheat it to 450°F.\nPlace a 14-inch round nonstick pizza baking pan or a large piece of parchment paper in front of you on a flat surface\nThe dough will be super soft, and should only be handled once you’ve coated your hands in olive oil. Turn the dough out onto the center of the pan or paper.\nWorking from the center of the dough out to the edges, begin to press it into a round about 14-inches in diameter.\nCreate a smooth, slightly raised edge around the perimeter of the dough by pressing the edges with one hand toward the palm of your other.\nBrush the shaped dough with more oil, concentrating it on the edges.\nTransfer the shaped and topped dough, still on the pizza baking sheet or parchment paper, to a pizza peel or other flat surface like a cutting board, and transfer it to the hot oven.\nBake for 5 to 6 minutes, or until the crust seems set all the way to the center and the edges have expanded in size.\nRemove the pan from the oven, top the dough with sauce, cheese, and any other toppings you like best, and return the pizza on the pan or paper to the oven.\nBake until the has begun to crisp on the underside, is lightly brown on the edges, and the cheese is brown and bubbling (about 5 minutes).\nRemove from the oven, allow to set for just a few minutes, then slice and serve hot.",

      "reviewBody": "This crust is wonderful!! I have been trying gluten free pizza crust recipes for almost 3 years--this is by far the best. I had purchased some Caputo Fioreglut flour several months ago but when I read the package instructions, I was totally intimidated. Nicole, your modification is easy and simply works. My good-natured, not gluten free husband, will eat anything I put in front of him. He said that this was the first GF pizza that tasted like regular pizza! This might end my search :)\r\n\r\nThank you, Nicole"

      "reviewBody": "Long time gluten free and this is the best pizza flour around. It makes an amazing Detroit Style pizza as well. This recipe fits the bill for a nice thinner style pizza. I made the recipe as is and it was good but a touch gummy as gluten free dough can be. Second round, made the recipe with amounts and volumes as is but activated the yeast beforehand and due to timing ended up proofing for 2hr. To protect the dough from gumminess, I layered provolone on the crust after the 6min crust cook step. This helps to keep the sauce from making the dough soupy or gummy. Crust cook, provolone, pepperoni, sauce, mozzarella to top it off and it was an A+! Keeping this as a favorite. Thank you!"
