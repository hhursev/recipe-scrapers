  "ingredients": [
    "1 pound sushi-grade tuna loin (center cut, block style)",
    "1 tablespoon neutral oil (grapeseed or canola)",
    "3 tablespoons soy sauce",
    "1 tablespoon chili crisp (with some of its oil)",
    "1 tablespoon lemon juice (freshly squeezed)",
    "1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil",
    "1 teaspoon freshly grated ginger",
    "Thinly sliced scallions",
    "Toasted sesame seeds",
    "Shaved radish or daikon"
  ],
  "instructions_list": [
    "Make the sauce:In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, chili crisp, lemon juice, sesame oil, and grated ginger until combined. Set aside so the flavors meld.",
    "Prepare the tuna:Pat the tuna dry with paper towels. Coat in toasted sesame seeds.",
    "Heat a heavy skillet (cast iron works best) over high heat. Add the neutral oil. Once shimmering hot, sear the tuna for about 45 seconds per side. The goal is a crisp, smoky exterior while keeping the interior nearly raw. Immediately transfer to a cutting board. Let rest for 1–2 minutes.",
    "Slice:With a very sharp knife, slice the tuna crosswise into thin pieces (about ¼-inch thick).",
    "Assemble:Arrange the slices on a chilled plate in a fan or overlapping row. Spoon some of the sauce over the tuna, and serve the rest on the side for dipping. Garnish with scallions, sesame seeds, and/or radish, if using."
