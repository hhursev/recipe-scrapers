    "Place chicken thighs in a bowl and cover with buttermilk. Marinate for 8 hours or overnight in the refrigerator.",
    "In a large bowl, combine potato starch, rice flour, tapioca flour, and Mexican Fiesta seasoning.",
    "Remove chicken from buttermilk, allowing excess to drip off. Dredge each thigh thoroughly in the flour mixture, pressing gently to ensure coating adheres. For the best crispy edges, let it sit in the flour mixture for 10 minutes.",
    "Heat oil in a large heavy-bottomed pot to 375 degrees F.",
    "Carefully fry chicken thighs until golden brown and cooked through (internal temperature should reach 165 degrees F), about 6-8 minutes.",
    "Transfer to a wire rack set over a sheet tray. Season immediately with salt while hot.",
    "In a medium saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Whisk in flour and cook for 1-2 minutes to create a roux, whisking constantly. Add nutmeg and tomato paste, whisking to combine.",
    "Gradually add milk, whisking continuously to prevent lumps. Cook until thickened, about 5 minutes.",
    "Remove from heat and gradually stir in grated cheddar cheese until melted and smooth. Keep warm.",
    "Make Parmesan crisps: Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add a small pile of shredded Parmesan to the center of the pan, spreading it into a thin, even circle. Cook until golden and crispy, about 2 minutes per side. Carefully remove with a spatula and set aside. Repeat as needed.",
    "Prepare arugula: Toss baby arugula with a drizzle of olive oil and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. Season lightly with salt.",
    "Toast buns: Toast sesame seed buns until golden brown.",
    "Build sandwiches:",
    "Serving Tip: Serve immediately while the chicken is hot and the Parmesan crisps are still crispy for the best texture."
