    "Preheat your oven to 325°F. Get out a roasting pan that is large enough to hold a 9-inch cheesecake pan.",
    "Wrap the springform pan in heavy duty aluminum foil tightly, to prevent water from getting into the pan while it bakes.",
    "Combine the crust ingredients until completely mixed together, then press onto bottom and slightly up the sides of 9-inch springform pan.",
    "Beat the cream cheese until smooth. Slowly add in the cup of granulated sugar, beating on low until all of the sugar is combined. Mix in the vanilla.",
    "Add in the eggs, one at a time, mixing on low speed after each egg mixing just until blended.",
    "Carefully pour/spoon the filling over the curst in the bottom of the pan, being careful not to disturb the crust. Place the pan into the middle of the roasting pan.",
    "Boil enough water in a kettle so that the cheesecake pan sits in one inch of water. Pour the water around the cheesecake pan, being careful not to splash into the cheesecake.",
    "Bake for 55 minutes or until the center of the cheesecake is almost set. It should be slightly jiggly. Remove from the oven and cool for 20 minutes. Then remove the pan from the water and continue to cool.",
    "Run a knife around the inside rim of the pan to loosen the cheesecake.",
    "Let the cheesecake cool completely then remove the rim. Refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours then slice and serve.",
    "Store in the refrigerator covered for up to 4-5 days."
