    "Preheat your oven: Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C) and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease it.",
    "Mix the tofu seasoning: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the nutritional yeast, soy sauce, olive oil (or vegetable broth for oil-free), chili powder, garlic powder, and liquid smoke to create a thick, brown paste.",
    "Crumble the tofu: Break the tofu into large chunks and add them to the bowl with the seasoning. Use a potato masher or fork to mash the tofu into crumbles. Stir the tofu crumbles well to coat evenly in the seasoning.",
    "Bake the Tofu: Spread the seasoned tofu crumbles evenly over the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 30-40 minutes, stirring every 15 minutes to prevent burning and ensure even browning. The tofu will dry out and become chewy; the longer it bakes, the chewier and drier it will get. For a more tender, meaty texture, bake the tofu for closer to 30 minutes. For a chewier, meatier texture, bake for closer to 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside.",
    "Cook the Pasta: While the tofu bakes, bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook your pasta according to the package directions.",
    "Heat the Sauce: While the pasta cooks, pour the marinara sauce into a large saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Once the tofu is baked, stir it into the sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add a splash of water to adjust the consistency. Let the sauce simmer on medium heat for about 5 minutes, allowing the tofu to absorb the flavors and the texture to become chewy and meaty. Season with salt and pepper to taste if desired.",
    "Serve: Serve the vegan Bolognese sauce over the cooked pasta. Garnish with fresh parsley or basil, and sprinkle with vegan Parmesan if desired."
