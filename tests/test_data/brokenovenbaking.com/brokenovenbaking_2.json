    "Make the Chocolate Ganache",
    "Place the chocolate chips in a small-medium bowl. Heat the heavy whipping cream (in the microwave or over the stove) until it's simmering.",
    "Pour the hot cream over the chocolate chips so they're completely covered in it. Place a plate over the bowl to trap the steam for 5 minutes.When the time's up, stir in a circular motion until it's a smooth ganache. Set aside.",
    "Make the Oreo Crusts",
    "Add the Oreo cookies and melted butter into a food processor. Pulse until they're crushed into a wet sand-like texture.",
    "Evenly distribute the crumbs throughout 12 muffin liners in a muffin pan (about 1-2 tablespoons per muffin cup).",
    "Press down with the bottom of a small cup to pack them down firmly. Place the pan in the freezer while making the filling.",
    "Make the Chocolate Cheesecake Filling",
    "In a medium-large bowl, mix the cream cheese with an electric mixer (or spatula). This is to make sure it's softened and doesn't have any lumps.",
    "Using your electric mixer or a whisk, whip the chocolate ganache until it's light and airy. Fold it into the cream cheese just until combined.",
    "Assemble the Cheesecakes",
    "Evenly distribute the chocolate cheesecake filling on top of the Oreo crusts. I like to use a small-medium cookie scoop for this! Spread the filling so it covers the crusts and is smooth on top.",
    "Let the cheesecakes firm up by chilling them in the refrigerator for a few hours before serving. Top with whipped cream and extra crushed Oreos, and enjoy!"
