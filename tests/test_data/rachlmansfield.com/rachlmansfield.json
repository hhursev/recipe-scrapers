They were DELICIOUS. Made some substitutions which allowed me to finish a bunch of almost-empty nut butters, so I did mostly tahini, some Trader Joes mixed nut butter, and a bit of peanut butter. I also didn't have coconut sugar so I used raw turbinado sugar since it has a similar consistency. One small mistake I made was that I accidentally used corn starch instead of baking powder (whoops, both cans looked the same!), so they may not have risen as much as they would have, but still tasted incredible. Next time I plan on adding walnuts too :)"

      "reviewBody": "Another amazing recipe--thank you! I have made a number of your sweet and savory recipes, and they are all excellent and come together just as you describe. I totally trust in your recipes, and it is such a relief to have found you as I was really struggling to make quality gf baked goods, which was really frustrating (and expensive). For this recipe, I used 1/2 tahini and 1/2 almond butter, and I baked them in a muffin pan because I don't have an 8x8 pan--they are fudgy and moist and pair perfectly with a glass of (almond) milk! All of the stars!"

      "reviewBody": "This is a great &amp; easy recipe! The brownies are chocolatey and thick with the right amount of sweetness. I used this recipe recently to make birthday cupcakes. So I added an extra egg to the recipe &amp; excluded the hu gems. Once the cupcakes were cool I melted the hu gems and dipped the top of the cupcakes in it &amp; added a strawberry on top. They looked &amp; tasted amazing. We are paleo and my child has developed a serious nut allergy. I'm so so glad to have found this recipe since so many paleo treats have almond flour. One question- any idea how these are after being frozen?"
