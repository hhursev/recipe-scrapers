  "instructions_list": [
    "Prep",
    "First grease a round baking pan of 7.5 inches diameter with oil. You could also line the pan with a parchment paper. Or use two round cake pans (6 inches diameter) and divide the batter equally between two pans.",
    "Preheat your oven to 200 degrees Celsius/392 degrees Fahrenheit.",
    "Sift whole wheat flour, cocoa powder, salt, baking soda on a plate. Use good quality cocoa powder.",
    "In another pan or bowl, take sugar.",
    "Add cold water. Stir and mix until all the sugar dissolves.",
    "Add oil. Stir briskly for 2 to 3 minutes so that everything is mixed well and emulsifies. Use any neutral oil.",
    "Add lemon juice and vanilla extract. Stir and mix again.",
    "If you do not have lemon juice, use 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar or white vinegar.",
    "Add the sieved dry ingredients to the wet mixture. Using a wired whisk, mix everything well until you get a smooth batter.",
    "Ensure that there are no lumps in the cake batter. The batter has a medium thin consistency.",
    "Pour the cake batter in the prepared cake pan or pans.",
    "Tap the pan/pans on the countertop, so that the extra air bubbles are let out.",
    "Baking chocolate sponge",
    "Placing the pans in the center rack of your oven, bake the cakes in the preheated oven at 200 degrees Celsius/392 Fahrenheit for 35 to 40 mins. Since temperatures vary from oven to oven, do keep a check.",
    "For baking in a convection mode of microwave oven, preheat the oven at 180 degrees Celsius/356 Fahrenheit degrees for 15 minutes. Then bake the cake at 180 degrees Celsius/356 degrees Fahrenheit for the 30 to 35 minutes.",
    "For doneness check the sponge cake with a tooth pick. The tooth pick should come out clean.",
    "If the tooth pick is sticky, then place the cake back in the oven and continue to bake for some more minutes.",
    "Place the pans on a wired tray and let the cakes cool at room temperature.",
    "Note that before frosting let the cake cool completely at room temperature or wrap the cake with a cling film and refrigerate for a couple of hours. You can keep the cake in a covered box and refrigerate.",
    "Whipping cream",
    "In a stand mixer take the the cold whipping cream and icing sugar/confectioner's sugar/powdered sugar.",
    "At the highest speed, whip until the cream becomes stiff. This process will vary depending on the power of your mixer.",
    "To check, just invert the bowl. If the cream does not fall, the cream has stiff peaks. Be sure not to over-whip your cream.",
    "Remember to chill the cream in the refrigerator at least for a day or two before you use it.",
    "If you have used the Indian brand of Amul cream it may take 8 to 10 minutes to whip.",
    "Assembling",
    "If you have baked one cake, then slice the cake neatly from the center with a large knife or serrated knife. You can also use dental floss to slice the cake into two.",
    "Place one layer of the cake with the bottom side facing you. If the top of your cake is domed, then slice the top domed portion evenly so it will lay flat.",
    "Make a sugar syrup dissolving 1 tablespoon sugar in 3 tablespoon water.",
    "Brush the cake lightly and evenly with this sugar syrup. You can also use rum or wine instead of sugar syrup.",
    "Frosting the sponge layers",
    "With a spatula spread about ¼ or ⅓ of the whipped cream on top of the cake.",
    "Then add a layer of finely chopped glazed red cherries. You can use canned red cherries, glazed cherries or fresh sweet cherries.",
    "Sprinkle grated chocolate or chocolate shavings all over.",
    "Cover with the second cake and brush the top with the sugar syrup.",
    "Spread again ⅓ part of the cream on the top evenly. Spread on the sides of the cake too. If you have a rotating cake stand, this will make frosting the cake much easier.",
    "TIP: If you don’t have a cake stand, then use a small, flat plate covered with aluminum foil and place the cake on it before icing. The foil covered plate along with the cake is kept on a heavy board. This way you can easily rotate the foil covered plate while spreading icing on the sides.",
    "Making Black Forest Cake",
    "Add the remaining whipped cream in a piping bag and use any decorative nozzle. Decorate the cake however you like.",
    "Place whole cherries on top of the cake. Top with some chocolate shavings or grated chocolate.",
    "Now cover the sides of the cake with the chocolate shavings. Take some chocolate shavings in your fingers. Gently pat and press them on the cream layer with your fingers.",
    "Turn the cake stand as you go on placing the chocolate shavings on the cream layer all over the sides. Some chocolate shavings will fall on the the cake stand. Collect these and use them for the decoration on the sides.",
    "Cover the cake with a large bowl without it touching the sides and place in the fridge for the cream icing to set. Keep to set for 3 to 4 hours or overnight.",
    "When the cream icing has set well, slice and serve eggless black forest cake.",
    "Serving Suggestions and Storage",
    "Serve black forest cake as is or for a rich luxurious treat pair with a chocolate or vanilla ice cream. Enjoy as an after meal dessert or as a sweet snack anytime of the day.",
    "The cake stays well for about 2 to 3 days in the refrigerator. Keep the cake in a covered box or container when storing in the fridge."
