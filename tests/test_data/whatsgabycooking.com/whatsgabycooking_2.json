      "reviewBody": "Fantastic! Lovely soft tender tasty meatballs. And the sauce is amazing, although maybe next time I won't put a much lemon... the one I had was quite large. Family of 5 are 2x the recipe with couscous (made using chicken stock with grape tomatoes and lemon juice) and streamed brocolini.\nYum!"

      "reviewBody": "I made these as written and they were a hit around the family, from youngest to oldest. Being a soccer coach, I work in the afternoons and evenings. I made these during the day and kept them in the fridge, along with a simple tomato/cucumber/red onion salad. I also cut up pita and brushed with olive oil and sprinkled with salt. When I got home from training, I popped the meatballs in the oven for 5 min, followed by the pita for a min to toast it, and dinner was ready! Next time I will try with ground turkey or chicken. Thank you for a a quick, weeknight recipe that can be prepped in advance and goes beyond the normal pasta/casserole/slow cooker dish (not that I have anything against those!)."

      "reviewBody": "I want to give TEN STARS. I made the greek chopped salad as well. What a wonderful dinner. I did cheat and used tzatziki from Trader Joes and added the feta. I also did not broil the meatballs- instead roasted at high temp (and probably overcooked a tiny bit but who cares when the taste is so good).\r\n\r\nYUM... had left overs for lunch yesterday. Oh so good."

This will definitely be added to the weeknight rotation.\r\nThe recipe directions are a little spare—it would be better to divide the ingredient list by meatball and tzatziki—but it works out as written."
