    "Cake:",
    "Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly grease a 9-inch** square baking pan and set aside.",
    "In a large bowl, whisk flour, brown sugar, cocoa, espresso powder, baking powder, and salt. Add milk, oil and vanilla and whisk until well combined and smooth. Using a rubber spatula, stir in chocolate chips.",
    "Transfer the batter to the prepared pan and spread into an even layer. Proceed with the topping.",
    "Topping:",
    "In a bowl, combine cocoa powder and brown sugar, mixing until well combined (I use a fork). Sprinkle this mixture in an even layer over the top of the cake batter.",
    "Slowly and carefully pour the boiling water evenly over the top. TIP: I pour the water over the back of a large spoon and slowly move it around the pan while pouring. Do not stir or disturb the cake batter underneath.",
    "Transfer to the oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, until the cake layer (on top) is cooked through. The pudding sauce should be bubbling gently around the sides of the pan. Place on a wire rack to cool for about 10 minutes. Serve warm, scooping the cake into bowls and spooning the sauce over the top. Recommended garnishes: vanilla ice cream or whipped cream."
