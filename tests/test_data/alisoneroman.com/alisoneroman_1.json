      "purpose": "Decidedly a tomato pasta with eggplant and not an eggplant pasta– so much so that the eggplant could easily be replaced with any vegetable– say, peppers, fennel or zucchini. The moral of the story is you can sauté any vegetable in sausage fat, add tomato sauce or puree and have a very good, saucy tomato pasta that’s more than the sum of its parts. With a little sausage on the side, it feels more like a “full dinner” and less like a “bowl of food”."

  "instructions_list": [
    "Heat olive oil in a large skillet or pot over medium heat. Add sausage and poke holes sporadically to allow fat and steam to escape. Cook, turning occasionally, until well browned and cooked through, 10–12 minutes.",
    "Remove sausage and set aside, leaving the fat in the pan. Add the eggplant and onion; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until eggplant is nicely browned and tender and onions start to fry at the edges, 10–15 minutes, adding more olive oil as needed.",
    "Add tomato (sauce, puree, or crushed) and season again with salt and pepper. Add about 2 cups water (rinse the jar or can to get all the bits) along with oregano and/or red pepper flakes. Bring to a simmer, occasionally crushing eggplant to encourage it to break down. Add the garlic and cook until the sauce thickens and eggplant is totally softened, 10–12 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until just al dente. Using a slotted spoon, transfer pasta to the sauce and cook together until pasta is fully cooked, another few minutes.",
    "Divide pasta among bowls; top with torn basil and grated Pecorino or Parmesan.",
    "Serve sausage on the side with the pasta and, if you like, a simple salad."
