    "Make Shortcakes",
    "Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. If you have them, arrange six 4-inch English muffin rings on the sheet.",
    "Whisk the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a mixing bowl.",
    "Cut the cold butter into small pieces and work it into the flour mixture with a pastry blender, your fingers, or two knives until it resembles coarse crumbs.",
    "Stir in the milk and egg until the batter just comes together.",
    "Divide the batter evenly among the rings (about 4 tablespoons each). They will spread out, no need to spread them before baking. If you do not have the rings, spoon the batter in tall mounds directly onto the parchment paper and gently smooth the top.",
    "Bake for 15 to 17 minutes, turning the baking sheet halfway through. Let the shortcakes cool completely before building and serving.",
    "Prepare the Strawberries and Cream",
    "While the shortcakes bake, prepare the strawberries. Place a medium bowl into the freezer to chill.",
    "Place a third of the strawberries in a saucepan with the sugar. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, just until the sugar dissolves.",
    "Pour the mixture into the chilled bowl, add the remaining strawberries, and refrigerate until chilled.",
    "Use a stand mixer or electric hand mixer to beat the heavy cream, sugar, and vanilla extract until medium peaks form. Refrigerate until ready to assemble.",
    "Assemble the Shortcakes",
    "Slice each shortcake in half horizontally (like an English muffin). Place the bottom half on a serving plate, drizzle with a spoonful of strawberry syrup, then add a generous spoonful of whipped cream. Use a slotted spoon to add some of the strawberries on top of the cream, and then place the other half of the shortcake on top. Repeat with more whipped cream and strawberries."

  "description": "This strawberry shortcake recipe is honestly so delicious! The secret to making it best is making the super simple strawberry syrup and drizzling some of it over the bottom of your shortcake before adding the whipped cream and strawberries. It softens the shortcake a bit and adds a lovely strawberry flavor. For perfect rounds, I love using 4-inch English muffin rounds. If you do not have these in your kitchen, you can still bake the shortcakes freeform on the baking sheet. They spread a bit more than if you use the rounds, but they still work well! See our photo in the article showing me baking the shortcake batter in rounds vs. freeform on the baking sheet.",
