    "In a stand mixer/large bowl, combine sugar, warm water, and yeast. Give it a quick mix, cover, and let yeast dissolve for 10 minutes.",
    "Add eggs, oil, and salt. Mix together. Then add the flour cup by cup while mixing in between. You have enough flour when 1- the dough doesn’t stick to the side of the bowl 2- the dough is tacky but doesn’t stick to your fingers. (Be careful not to add too much flour!)",
    "Knead for five minutes. If using a mixer- cover the dough while kneading to keep the heat inside.",
    "Cover the dough and let it rise 10 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375° F.",
    "Dump dough onto a floured surface. Divide in half and roll out each half into a large rectangle.",
    "On each half, spread 1/2 of the butter, and evenly sprinkle half of the sugar and orange zest.",
    "Tightly roll dough up into one long snake. Using thread or a very sharp knife, cut the dough (as shown in video) into 16 even slices per dough snake. (Discard the ends)",
    "Onto two greased jelly roll pans, evenly lay out all orange roll dough rounds, 16 per cookie sheet. Cover and let rise 10-30 minutes.",
    "Bake at 375° F for 14-15 minutes.",
    "For frosting: Whip the frosting ingredients together until it is light and smooth. When your orange rolls come out of the oven, spread the orange glaze all over the rolls! Enjoy!"
