  "instructions": "Put the pasta, 600ml of milk, 350ml of water, the butter, garlic, turmeric, 1 teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper into a large sauté pan on a medium-high heat. Bring to a simmer, then turn the heat down to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10–14 minutes, or until the pasta is al dente and the sauce has thickened from the pasta starches (it will still be quite saucy). If using cavatappi, you might need to add the extra 100ml of milk at this stage depending on how saucy you like your mac ’n’ cheese. Turn the heat down to low and stir through the cumin, cream and both cheeses until the cheddar is nicely melted.\nWhile the pasta is cooking, make the pesto. Finely grate the lemon to give you 1 teaspoon of zest. Then use a small, sharp knife to peel and segment the lemon and roughly chop the segments. Place in a bowl with the lemon zest and set aside. Put the za’atar, coriander, garlic, pine nuts, ⅛ teaspoon of salt, a good grind of pepper and half the oil into a food processor and pulse a few times until you have a coarse paste. Add to the chopped lemon in the bowl and stir in the remaining oil.\nTransfer the mac ’n’ cheese to a large serving platter with a lip or a shallow bowl, dot all over with the pesto, then top with the crispy onions.\nGet ahead: Make the mac ’n’ cheese ahead of time if you like, adding a splash of water to thin out when reheating.\nMake it your own:\n– Play with different cheeses and spices.\n– Use different pasta shapes like macaroni, adjusting liquid levels as necessary.\n",
