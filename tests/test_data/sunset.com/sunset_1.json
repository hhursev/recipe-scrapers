  "title": "Crisp-Top Sourdough Stuffing",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 1-pound loaf sourdough, at least 1 day old",
    "1/4 cup salted butter",
    "2 cups chopped onion (1 large)",
    "1 cup chopped celery (2 or 3 stalks)",
    "1/4 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley",
    "1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh sage",
    "About 1/2 tsp. kosher salt",

    "About 3 cups turkey broth, reduced-sodium chicken broth, or mushroom or other vegetable broth"
  ],
  "instructions_list": [
    "Step 1",
    "Slice bread into 1 1/2-in.-thick slices and tear into irregular 1- to 2-in. pieces. Spread on a rimmed baking sheet and leave to dry at room temperature until needed (up to 2 days). For the best stuffing, the bread should be very dry.",
    "Step 2",
    "Preheat oven to 350°. Melt butter in a large frying pan over medium heat. Pour out 2 tbsp. butter and set aside.",
    "Step 3",
    "Add onion, celery, herbs, and 1/2 tsp. each salt and pepper to hot pan. Cook until onions are translucent and celery is tender-crisp, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl.",
    "Step 4",
    "Add torn bread and broth to vegetables and mix in until bread is soaked. Add salt and pepper to taste.",
    "Step 5",
    "Generously coat a 9- by 13-in. glass baking pan with 1 tsp. reserved melted butter. Pour stuffing into pan and drizzle with remaining melted butter.",
    "Step 6",
    "Cover with foil; bake 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake until starting to brown on top, about 30 minutes more.",
    "Step 7",
    "Make ahead: Up to 2 days, chilled. Reheat at 350°, covered, until hot (about 30 minutes). Remove foil and cook 10 more minutes for a crunchy top layer.",
    "Step 8",
    "VARIATIONS",
    "Step 9",
    "Crisp-Top Sourdough Stuffing with Sausage and Greens: Add 8 oz. sautéed crumbled Italian ­sausage and 1 lb. briefly sautéed fresh spinach leaves to stuffing before baking.",
    "Step 10",
    "Scandinavian Stuffing: Replace sourdough with a 1-lb. loaf of crusty rye bread, then add 1 cup chopped fresh dill and 8 oz. diced smoked pork chops to stuffing before baking. Top with 2 tbsp. fresh dill sprigs before serving."

  "description": "Although it's nearly as quick to make as boxed stuffing, this homemade version--soft in the middle and a little crunchy on the top--is prettier and certainly tastier.",
