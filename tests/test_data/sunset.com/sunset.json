Add salt and pepper to taste.\nStep 5\n Generously coat a 9- by 13-in. glass baking pan with 1 tsp. reserved melted butter. Pour stuffing into pan and drizzle with remaining melted butter.\nStep 6\n Cover with foil; bake 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake until starting to brown on top, about 30 minutes more.\nStep 7\nMake ahead: Up to 2 days, chilled. Reheat at 350°, covered, until hot (about 30 minutes). Remove foil and cook 10 more minutes for a crunchy top layer.\nStep 8\nVARIATIONS\nStep 9\nCrisp-Top Sourdough Stuffing with Sausage and Greens: Add 8 oz. sautéed crumbled Italian ­sausage and 1 lb. briefly sautéed fresh spinach leaves to stuffing before baking.\nStep 10\nScandinavian Stuffing: Replace sourdough with a 1-lb. loaf of crusty rye bread, then add 1 cup chopped fresh dill and 8 oz. diced smoked pork chops to stuffing before baking.
