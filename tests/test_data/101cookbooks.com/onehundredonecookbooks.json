  "ingredients": [
    "1 14- ounce can of full fat coconut milk",
    "3 cloves garlic, smashed",
    "1 large yellow onion, chopped",
    "1 small serrano chile, stemmed and chopped",

  "instructions": "Scoop a big spoonful of thick coconut cream from the top of the coconut milk can. Add it to a large pan over medium-high heat. When hot, stir in the garlic, onions, chile, and salt.

Simmer just long enough for the broccoli to get tender throughout, 2 - 4 minutes.\nImmediately remove the soup from heat and puree with an immersion blender. Add more water if you feel the need to thin the soup out. Taste and add more salt if needed.\nServe sprinkled with tofu cubes, toasted almonds, and lots of scallions.",
