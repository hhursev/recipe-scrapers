Simmer just long enough for the broccoli to get tender throughout, 2 - 4 minutes.\nImmediately remove the soup from heat and puree with an immersion blender. Add more water if you feel the need to thin the soup out. Taste and add more salt if needed.\nServe sprinkled with tofu cubes, toasted almonds, and lots of scallions.",
