    "Mix all lentils mentioned above, wash them few times and soak them for 6-8 hours.",
    "Once soaked, drain all the water out. Wrap it in a muslin/cotton cloth. Place it in a strainer with a plate underneath it. Place the whole set up in a dark place. I like to place it in an oven (THAT IS NOT ON) for 12 hours to let them sprout.",

    "Once sprouted, rinse them with water. Drain all the water out.",
    "Place drained sprouted beans in a blender/food processor with rest of the ingredients listed above. Keep blending till you get pancake like consistency. 2 cups of water as mentioned above should be enough to get the right consistency, but you can add more or less if you like. you can leave it grainy or smooth based on your preference.",
    "Once the batter is ready, it's ready to make the chilla/wrap. You can either use it right away or refrigerate it up to 3 days and use it as you like!",
    "Heat up cast irons skillet/choice of tawa. Spray avocado oil or use any type of oil to grease the skillet/tawa.",
    "Spread a thin (or thick, as you like) layer of batter on greasy hot skillet/tawa. Spray/drizzle some more oil on top, cover and let it cook on medium heat (closer to high but not too high) for about a min or so, until you see charred brown marks on the side facing down.",
    "Flip it and cook on the other side for few more second, until it starts showing some brown spots.",
    "Repeat the same process for as mnay wraps/chilla you like to make.",
    "Simply enjoy it with choice of subzi/dal/pickle/yogurt. Or top it with crunchy veggie salad. Drizzle creamy tahini sauce & spicy garlicky red pepper sauce as mentioned in my Falafel recipe. Wrap it and enjoy like a wrap!"
