    "Making Falafel",
    "Mix all lentils mentioned above, wash them few times and soak them for 6-8 hours.",
    "Once soaked for 6-8 hours, drain all the water our and grind them along with clean cilantro & parsley, serrano, garlic, ginger, coarsely ground coriander seeds.",
    "Try not to use any or too much water to grind it. The batter should be just a little grainy and thick so that you can form balls to deep fry. Please know that the falafel mix will start loosing moisture as time goes. I recommend you deep frying soon after grinding",
    "Right before you are ready to deep fry, mix in salt and baking soda.",
    "Make a bit smaller than golf ball sized balls, deep fry them in hot oil on medium heat until all sides are nicely brown and crispy.",
    "Make Creamy Tahini Sauce",
    "Simply blend everything listed under \"Creamy Tahini Sauce\". Blend it to creamy sauce consistency. Please know that this sauce will thicken as time goes. Take the sauce out in a mason jar and use the same blender without washing it to make the red sauce. Can be stored in a mason jar inside the fridge for upto 4-5 days.",
    "Make Spicy Red Garlicky Sauce",
    "Soak hot whole dry red chili in warm water for 10-15 min.",
    "Use the same unwashed blender you made the tahini sauce in to make red sauce. Red peppers have very high water content, using a tiny bit of creamy while sauce that is stuck in the blender will help the consistency of red sauce!",
    "Blend soaked hot whole dry red chili (without water), dark fresh red peppers (without seeds & stems), salt and garlic. Can be stored in a mason jar inside the fridge for upto 4-5 days.",
    "Assemble",
    "Mix everything listed under \"Mixed Veggies/Salad\". Make sure all the veggies are well coated with Creamy Tahini Sauce. Use more or less tahini sauce as you like!",
    "Warm pita pocket for few second. Pack it half way through with \"Mixed Veggies/Salad\". Drizzle spicy red sauce, top it with falafel. Drizzle white & red sauces. Top it with more \"Mixed Veggies/Salad\" and enjoy!!"
