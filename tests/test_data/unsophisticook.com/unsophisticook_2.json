    "Season pork chops on both sides with salt and pepper. Drizzle the olive oil in a large skillet set over medium-high heat. Brown pork chops on both sides, then remove the browned chops to a plate.",
    "Add the butter to the skillet and sauté the onion slices over medium heat until translucent. Add the garlic and sauté for about one additional minute. Then add the broth to the skillet and use a wooden spatula to scrape up any brown bits from the bottom.",
    "Add the bay leaf, paprika, and salt to the onion mixture, and then place pork chops back in the skillet. Cover tightly, and reduce the heat. Simmer over low heat for about 20 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F.",
    "Remove the chops to a plate again and cover with aluminum foil. Remove the bay leaf from the remaining hot liquid.",
    "Whisk the flour and water together well, and pour them into the broth mixture. Heat the sauce to boiling, whisking constantly. Allow to reduce and thicken. Remove the skillet from the heat and let cool slightly. Stir the sour cream into the gravy mixture and return the pork chops to the sour cream sauce."
