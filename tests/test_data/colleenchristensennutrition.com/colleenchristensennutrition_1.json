  "title": "No Churn Mississippi Mud Pie Ice Cream",
  "ingredients": [
    "½ cup warm milk",
    "2 tbsp instant coffee",
    "2 cups heavy whipping cream (cold)",
    "1, 14 oz can of sweetened condensed milk",
    "1, 3.9 oz box of chocolate pudding mix",
    "2 tsp vanilla extract",
    "1.5 cup crushed Oreos + 2 tbsp",
    "1/2 cup chocolate chunks + 2 tbsp",
    "1/2 cup chocolate syrup + 1 tbsp"
  ],
  "instructions_list": [
    "To heat your milk you can microwave it for 1 minute. Add 2 tbsp instant coffee to it and mix. Place it back in the fridge or freezer to cool fully.",
    "Next, pour your heavy whipping cream into a large bowl or stand mixer. Begin to mix on low then slowly increase speed. Mix for ~3 minutes until stiff peaks form and you’ve made whipped cream!",
    "In a separate large bowl, combine sweetened condensed milk, cooled instant coffee milk, chocolate pudding mix, and vanilla extract.",
    "Gently fold in your whipped cream to the sweetened condensed milk mixture. Do not stir this vigorously! You don’t want to reduce the air in the whipped cream. Fold until mixture is uniform.",
    "Next, fold in 1.5 cups crushed Oreos and ½ cup chocolate chunks",
    "Now, fill your ice cream container. Pour 1/3 of your ice cream mixture into a ~6+ cup container (you can also use a loaf pan!). Now, add ¼ cup of chocolate sauce and then use a knife to gently swirl it in. Repeat this process: ⅓ of the ice cream, ⅓ of the chocolate sauce, swirl, repeat! You’ll end with the chocolate sauce. Then you’ll add 1-2 tbsp crushed cookies, 1-2 tbsp of chocolate chunks and 1 tbsp of chocolate syrup. Press everything down slightly.",
    "Freeze for 8 hours.",
    "Once frozen, remove from the freezer and enjoy!"
