    "Place the chicken in a ziploc bag or in a shallow dish. In a small bowl, stir the olive oil, garlic powder, paprika, onion powder, parsley, salt, and pepper together, then pour the mixture over the chicken. Seal the bag, then shake so that the chicken is coated in the seasoning mixture. Allow the chicken to marinade for at least 30 minutes, or up to 24 hours in the fridge.",
    "Heat the grill to medium heat (about 400°F). Once hot, place the chicken smooth-side down and grill for 5 minutes. Use tongs to flip over and cook for an additional 3-5 minutes. If using cheese, place a piece of cheese on each piece of chicken during the last minute of cooking.",
    "Let the chicken sit on a cutting board for 5 minutes before assembling the sandwich, which will allow the chicken to finish cooking.",
    "Assemble the sandwiches: place chicken on a bun, then top with bacon, tomato and lettuce. Spread mayo on the top bun, then place it on top. Enjoy!"
