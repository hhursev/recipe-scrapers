    "To prep the poblanos: Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. Place the poblanos in a bowl and toss with olive oil until well coated. Transfer to the grill and cook, rotating occasionally, until all the peppers are charred.",
    "Transfer to a bowl, cover with a plate, and let rest for 10 minutes.",
    "To prep the skewers: Cube the paneer, cutting roughly 16 pieces from the cheese. Thinly slice the zucchini about ⅛” thick. If the zucchini you’re working with is larger, cut the zucchini slices in half, creating half-moons. You want the zucchini slices to be roughly the same width as the paneer so everything grills evenly.",
    "Thread a few pieces of zucchini onto a metal skewer, followed by a piece of paneer. Repeat this with 3 more pieces, layering zucchini between the pieces of cheese. Repeat with 3 more skewers. Each skewer should have approximately 4 pieces of cheese and 5 groups of zucchini.",
    "Place the zucchini on a plate and coat with the olive oil and salt.",
    "To finish the sauce: Before grilling, finish the sauce. Place the minced garlic and vinegar in a medium bowl. Remove the skin, stem, and seeds from the poblanos. Place on a cutting board and mince until the peppers look near paste-like.",
    "Transfer the peppers to the bowl with the garlic. Mince the basil and add it to the bowl along with the miso. Mash until the mixture resembles a paste, then drizzle in enough olive oil to loosen it into a thick sauce. Taste and add salt as needed.",
    "To finish the skewers: Place them on the grill and grill until charred, flipping to cook each side. Transfer to a plate and spoon half the sauce over the grilled skewers. Flip, spooning the other half of the sauce over the skewers.",
    "Place the grains on a medium serving platter and top with the skewers. Spoon any sauce that fell off the skewers in the previous step and serve."
