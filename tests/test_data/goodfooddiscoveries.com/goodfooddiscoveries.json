Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the rice is lightly toasted.\nAdd the white wine to the pan and stir until it's absorbed by the rice.\nBegin adding the warm broth to the rice mixture, one cup at a time, stirring constantly until each cup of broth is absorbed before adding the next. Continue to stir frequently to ensure that the rice doesn't stick to the pan.\nWhen the rice is tender and the mixture is creamy, after about 20-25 minutes, remove the pan from heat.\nAdd the butter, parmesan cheese, lemon zest, and lemon juice to the pan and stir until the butter is melted and the cheese is fully incorporated.\nSeason the risotto with salt and pepper to taste. If the risotto is too thick, add additional broth or water, one tablespoon at a time, until it reaches your desired consistency.\nServe the lemon risotto hot, garnished with fresh parsley.",
