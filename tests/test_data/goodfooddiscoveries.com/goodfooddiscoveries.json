  "ingredients": [
    "1 1/2 cups (300g) Arborio rice",

    "1/2 cup (120ml) dry white wine",
    "1 small onion, finely chopped",

Add the onion and garlic, and sauté until the onion is soft and translucent, about 3-4 minutes.\nAdd the Arborio rice to the pan and stir to coat it in the oil. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the rice is lightly toasted.\nAdd the white wine to the pan and stir until it's absorbed by the rice.\nBegin adding the warm broth to the rice mixture, one cup at a time, stirring constantly until each cup of broth is absorbed before adding the next.

If the risotto is too thick, add additional broth or water, one tablespoon at a time, until it reaches your desired consistency.\nServe the lemon risotto hot, garnished with fresh parsley.",
