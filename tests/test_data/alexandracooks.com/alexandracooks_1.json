  "instructions": "In a high-speed blender combine the cashews, ice water, salt, lemon juice, garlic, olive oil, and maple syrup. Blend at low speed for 10 seconds, then turn the blender to its highest setting and blend for another 50 seconds.\nThe mixture should be completely smooth. Taste. And adjust with a pinch of flaky sea salt if necessary. Add the chives, and blend on low for another 10 seconds.\nThe mixture will be slightly warm due to the intensity of the blending, and because of this, it’s difficult to accurately evaluate the flavor. Because of this, I recommend transferring it to a storage vessel and transferring it to the fridge for at least 2 hours before using. In this time, the ranch flavors will intensify and the dressing will thicken — you may want to thin the dressing with another tablespoon of water to make it a more pourable consistency before using. You may also want to add a pinch more kosher salt or flaky sea salt to taste.",

  "description": "Adapted from The Full Helping's all-purpose cashew cream recipe. Notes: Salt: If you are using Morton Kosher salt or fine sea salt, use 3/4 teaspoon (or the same amount by weight. I have only ever used a high speed blender, which makes an especially creamy dressing without having to soak the cashews. If you do not have a Vitamix or other powerful blender, consider soaking the cashews in water for at least 2 hours before making the dressing.",
