  "title": "Vegan Ranch Dressing (Cashew, No-Soak)",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 cup (135 g) raw cashews",
    "3/4 cup (176 g) ice water, plus more as needed",
    "1½ (5 g) teaspoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt, see notes above",
    "1/4 cup (65 g) fresh lemon juice",
    "1 garlic clove",
    "2 tablespoons (28 g) extra-virgin olive oil",
    "1 teaspoon maple syrup",
    "1/2 cup (20 g) chives",
    "Flaky sea salt, optional, to taste"
  ],
  "instructions_list": [
    "In a high-speed blender combine the cashews, ice water, salt, lemon juice, garlic, olive oil, and maple syrup. Blend at low speed for 10 seconds, then turn the blender to its highest setting and blend for another 50 seconds.",
    "The mixture should be completely smooth. Taste. And adjust with a pinch of flaky sea salt if necessary. Add the chives, and blend on low for another 10 seconds.",
    "The mixture will be slightly warm due to the intensity of the blending, and because of this, it’s difficult to accurately evaluate the flavor. Because of this, I recommend transferring it to a storage vessel and transferring it to the fridge for at least 2 hours before using. In this time, the ranch flavors will intensify and the dressing will thicken — you may want to thin the dressing with another tablespoon of water to make it a more pourable consistency before using. You may also want to add a pinch more kosher salt or flaky sea salt to taste."

  "description": "Adapted from The Full Helping's all-purpose cashew cream recipe. Notes: Salt: If you are using Morton Kosher salt or fine sea salt, use 3/4 teaspoon (or the same amount by weight. I have only ever used a high speed blender, which makes an especially creamy dressing without having to soak the cashews. If you do not have a Vitamix or other powerful blender, consider soaking the cashews in water for at least 2 hours before making the dressing.",

      "reviewBody": "Just made this to go with the Indian-ish nachos with cheddar black beans and chutney from the NYT. I only have a food processor so it took some extra water and a few minutes rather than one and I soaked roasted salted cashews (what I had in hand) and just omitted the salt. It’s probably not as creamy as if I had used a VitaMix but it’s still smooth enough and the flavor is fantastic! I can’t wait to see how much better it is after it sits in the fridge a couple hours. Has a bit of a green goddess vibe. Thanks for sharing!"
