    "Heat oven to 325¬∫F.",
    "Calculate your ham's cooking time",
    "For this recipe, you‚Äôre going to roast your ham for 10 minutes a pound total, but you‚Äôre going to crank the oven temperature up to 425¬∫F during the last 30 minutes, during which time you‚Äôll glaze it twice. So, calculate your ham‚Äôs total cooking time; then subtract 30 minutes to calculate how long the ham will be in the oven for the first portion of the cooking period. (For example, if your ham weighs 13.69 lbs, you‚Äôll roast it for 1 hour and 45 minutes at 325¬∫F; then 30 minutes at 425¬∫F.)",
    "Place ham, fat side up, in a roasting pan large enough to fit it. Add 2 cups of water or enough so that the water reaches about 1/2 inch up the sides of the pan. Cover the pan tightly with foil and transfer to the oven. Set the timer for the amount of time you calculated in step 2.",
    "Meanwhile, make the glaze",
    "whisk together the brown sugar, maple syrup, and freshly squeezed orange juice. Set aside.",
    "After the first portion of the cooking is complete, remove the ham from the oven, and increase the oven temperature to 425¬∫F. Remove the foil. Brush the ham all over generously with the glaze and return the ham to the oven for 15 minutes. Brush the ham again generously all over with the glaze and cook for another 15 minutes. (If you have any leftover glaze, dump it over the ham during the last 5 minutes of cooking time.)",
    "Remove ham from the oven and let rest for at least 20 minutes before carving.",
    "Carve by removing large chunks of meat and slicing up those chunks. See video for guidance. Don‚Äôt worry too much about the ham bone ‚Äî save that for after dinner. Remove as much meat as possible. Save the bone for soup."

  "description": "This is a very simple baked ham recipe. There's no scoring and no studding with cloves, because neither of those steps is necessary. Using a moist heat cooking method for the first half of the process, followed by a blast of high heat at the end to caramelize the surface will yield a beautifully burnished ham with moist, tender meat. Ham: I am a huge fan of Dakin Farm hams (no affiliation here ... truly just a long-time fan since my VT aunt and uncle introduced me to their products years ago.) I think the secret to making a good ham lies in the quality of the ham itself. Regardless of what brand you use, you need a cooked ham. All you're doing here is reheating it. Notes: Dakin recommends estimating 1/4 lb per person buffet style or 1/2 lb per person for dinner, depending on appetites. Cook 10 minutes a pound at 325¬∫F. Cook fat-side up in a roasting pan filled with about 1/2 inch of water covered tightly in foil for the bulk of the time. During the last 30 minutes, remove the foil, crank the heat up to 425¬∫F, brush with a simple glaze at least twice. Let rest 20 minutes before carving.",

Clearly we are keeping it, but I'm not sure how to prepare it for Christmas dinner. Do I try to cook it in the same way? Any suggestions?"

Plus letting us know that not scoring the ham is ok, you know? I had watched a few videos and read thru a few recipes online before finding yours- and I'm so thankful I did! It was your directions and your video that gave me the courage to finally take the ham out of the wrapper lol. In the end, my ham came out beautifully. Thank you so much!! üòä"

Ordered the half ham from Dakin:) For Christmas Day lunch, I put out the leftovers along with some King‚Äôs rolls, good Swiss cheese, your orange-arugula salad, and some other munchies. Your site was truly a lifesaver for a busy working mom who wanted to make some great food that felt special but without standing in front of the stove for hours. Major bonus was the delicious leftovers we‚Äôre still happily picking at. Thank you!!"

I dont understand how you cooked a 13lb ham in 1 hour and 45 minutes.  I believe its 30 min in oven per lb.  Anyways, after some strenuous math, yours should have been baked for 6.5 hours.  Am I missing something?\r\n\r\nThanks! "
