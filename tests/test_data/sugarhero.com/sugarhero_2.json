    "Make the Chocolate Ganache",
    "Chop the chocolate into small pieces and place it in a large bowl. Place the softened butter on top. Set aside.",
    "Put the heavy cream in a saucepan over medium-high. Heat until it simmers and bubbles appear along the sides of the pan, but do not bring it to a boil.",
    "Pour the hot cream over the chopped chocolate and whisk it together until the chocolate melts and the mixture is shiny and smooth.",
    "Cover with cling wrap, pressing down until the plastic is touching the top of the ganche. Allow it to firm up to a spoonable consistency (like peanut butter) by setting it out for 1-2 hours at room temperature (overnight is even better).",
    "Or, to firm the ganache faster, place it in the refrigerator and whisk every 15 minutes until it has a spoonable consistency. Do not leave it in the fridge too long, or it will get hard! If it accidentally gets too hard, let it rest at room temperature (or microwave briefly), then stir until the consistency is spreadable again.",
    "Make the Chocolate Cake",
    "Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C) and place the oven rack in the center of the oven. Use a non-stick baking spray or butter to grease a 17x12-inch (43x30cm) baking pan. Line the pan with foil or parchment paper, spray it well with baking spray, and then sprinkle liberally with cocoa powder to help prevent sticking.",
    "While the eggs are still cold, separate the eggs, placing the whites in one bowl and the yolks in another. Cover with a lid or plastic wrap, and bring to room temperature before using (about 30 minutes).",
    "Meanwhile, melt the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl in 30 second increments, stirring well between each, until smooth. Remove from microwave and cool. (Alternately, melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl placed over a saucepan of simmering water, stirring occasionally until smooth. Remove from heat and cool.)",
    "Place the egg yolks and 1/4 cup of sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or use a hand mixer) and beat them on medium-high speed to reach the “ribbon stage\" (about 5 minutes). See Note below.",
    "Mix in the vanilla extract and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Then add the cooled, melted chocolate and beat until just combined. Set aside.",
    "In a clean mixing bowl, with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites until foamy. Add the cream of tartar and beat at medium-high speed until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar until stiff peaks form. See Note below.",
    "Gently fold a small amount of egg white mixture (about ¼ cup) into the chocolate egg yolk mixture using a rubber spatula or whisk. Once incorporated, fold in the remaining whites just until combined. Don’t over mix or the batter will deflate.",
    "Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan. Bake until the cake is puffed, has lost its shine, and springs back when gently pressed, about 15-17 minutes.",
    "Remove from the oven and sprinkle the top generously with cocoa powder. Then cover the cake with a clean, slightly damp tea towel to keep the cake moist. Place the covered cake on a wire rack to cool to room temperature (approximately 30-45 minutes).",
    "Make the Whipped Cream",
    "In a clean mixing bowl fitted with a whisk attachment, beat together all the whipped cream ingredients until the cream starts to hold firm peaks. Be careful not to whip past firm peaks or the cream will curdle and look more buttery with a chunky texture.",
    "Cover the filling and refrigerate until you're ready to assemble the cake.",
    "Assemble the Bûche De Noël",
    "Once the cake has fully cooled, remove the towel and gently spread the whipped filling over the surface of the cake.",
    "The cake can be rolled in the pan it was baked in or on a flat surface. (If you remove the cake from the pan, use the excess foil like handles to lift it from the pan in one piece.) Gently roll the cake, peeling off the foil or parchment paper as you roll. Don't worry if the cake cracks a little, it’ll be covered with ganache and other decorations.",
    "Trim one end of the cake at an angle and set it aside. Then place the cake, seam side down, on your serving platter. Take the reserved slice and place it on top of the cake to resemble a branch growing off the log.",
    "Gently spread the ganache over the outside of the cake. Once it's completely covered, use a spatula or a fork to create waves and texture in the ganache to resemble tree bark.",
    "For the best results cutting the cake, refrigerate it for 30 minutes to firm up slightly. If you are short on time the cake can be decorated and cut immediately.",
    "Just before serving, finish the buche de noel with edible natural looking decorations like meringue mushrooms (see Note below), sprinkled cocoa powder or chocolate shavings, candy rocks, powdered sugar or coconut, or anything else you have on hand.",
    "To get the cleanest cuts, heat a sharp knife under hot water for a few seconds, wipe the blade clean and cut the cake in 1-inch slices, wiping the blade clean between cuts.",
    "If you have leftovers, remove the mushrooms and place them in an airtight container at room temperture before refrigerating the rest of the cake. Place the cake in an airtight container or wrap it with a light covering of plastic wrap. For best taste and texture, enjoy within 5 days."
