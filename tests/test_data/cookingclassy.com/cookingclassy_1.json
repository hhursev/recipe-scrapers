  "instructions_list": [
    "Preheat oven to 225 degrees. Preheat an electric griddle to 350 degrees (a non-stick skillet set over medium heat also works fine).",

    "Dip bread into egg mixture allowing it to soak in, turn and soak on opposite side. Butter griddle area where you'll place slice of French toast, then top with the soaked French toast.",
