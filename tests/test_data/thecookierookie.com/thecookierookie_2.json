      "reviewBody": "I've been using your spice rub on grilled salmon for years, not because we follow the whole 30 plan but because it is so darn good!! I make it exactly as shown but I make extra rub per pound so it can generously coat every square inch of the fish. I like it with the salsa, but it is just as good on it's own. Thank you again for posting such a great recipe  that's  become a staple in my home!"
