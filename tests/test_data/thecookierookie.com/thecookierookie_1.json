  "title": "Brown Sugar Glazed Ham Recipe",
  "ingredients": [
    "14-16 pound bone-in ham",
    "3 cups water",
    "1 cup brown sugar",
    "½ cup honey",
    "⅓ cup Dijon mustard",
    "¼ cup unsalted butter (½ stick)",
    "¼ cup apple cider vinegar",
    "3 cloves garlic (minced)",
    "¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon",
    "¼ teaspoon ground ginger"

    "Preheat oven to 325°F.",
    "Score",
    "Place the ham on a cutting board. Score the ham by using a sharp knife to cut parallel lines about ½-inch deep and 1 inch apart across the entire ham. Turn the ham, and then repeat this process, cutting lines across the previous lines to create small diamond shapes.",
    "Cook",
    "Place the ham, flat side down, in a roasting pan. Pour 3 cups of water into the pan. Cover with foil. The ham should cook for about 12 minutes per pound.",
    "Prepare",
    "After 1 hour, prepare the glaze. Add the brown sugar, honey, dijon mustard, butter, apple cider vinegar, garlic, cinnamon, and ginger to a saucepan over medium heat. Once it starts bubbling, turn down the heat to low and continue cooking for a couple more minutes. The glaze may seem runny at first, but that’s okay. It will thicken up as it sits.",
    "Spread",
    "Remove the ham from the oven and spread ⅓ of the glaze over the ham and return to the oven without the foil. Continue cooking for another hour.",
    "Repeat",
    "Remove the ham from the oven again, and spread another ⅓ of the glaze over the ham. Cook for the remaining time based the weight of your ham.",
    "Remove the ham from the oven and spread the remaining glaze over the ham.",
    "Rest",
    "Let the ham rest for at least 15 minutes before carving."
