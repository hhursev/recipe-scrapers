    "Make Crispy Rice: Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C). Add 2 cups cooked and cooled rice to a bowl, along with 1 tbsp each chili garlic sauce, chili crunch oil, sesame oil and soy sauce, and the zest from 1 lime and juice from 1/2 of it. Stir to combine everything evenly. Place on baking sheet and bake for 25-35 minutes or just until crispy.",
    "While that's baking, to a large bowl, add the 5 mini sliced cucumbers, 2 cubed avocados, 1 chopped red bell pepper, 3-5 chopped green onions, 2 cups shredded cabbage, 1 cup each chopped peanuts, edamame, fresh chopped basil, and 1/2 cup chopped cilantro. Stir together very well.",
    "In a small blender, add 1/4 cup peanut butter, 3 tbsp each olive oil and rice vinegar, 3 cloves garlic, 1/2 lime juiced, 2 tbsp each toasted sesame oil and soy sauce, 1 1/2 cups maple syrup, and 1 inch grated ginger. Blend until combined.*Note: If you don't have a small blender, you can do this by whisking by hand, just finely mince the garlic first.",
    "When rice is finished, let cool and then add to the bowl with the peanut butter sauce and combine so the sauce is evenly all over."
