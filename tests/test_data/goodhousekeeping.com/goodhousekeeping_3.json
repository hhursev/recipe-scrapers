When the mixture is melted and smooth, lift the bowl off the pan.\nWhisk the sugar into the chocolate mixture, followed by the eggs, cocoa powder and flour.\nScrape the mixture into the prepared pot, cover the top with a tea towel (don’t let the towel touch the mixture) and put the lid on top. Turn the slow cooker on to its low setting (see GH TIP) and cook for about 2hr 45min until the middle feels softly set - it will look glossy but not feel sticky when pressed lightly with a finger. Uncover and cook for a further 30min. Turn off the cooker.\nLift the fondant out and dust with icing sugar, if you like. Serve immediately with ice cream or double cream.",
