    "For the Chocolate Bundt Cake:",
    "Position a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat oven to 325 degrees (F).",
    "In a large bowl, combine the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, salt, espresso, and both sugars. Mix on low until dry ingredients are thoroughly combined. Use your hands to break up any large clumps, if needed.",
    "In a separate bowl whisk the eggs, vanilla, sour cream, and oil, completely combined.",
    "Pour wet mixture into the dry ingredients and mix until just incorporated. Do not over mix.",
    "Pour in the hot water, and mix until combined. Set aside.",
    "Generously grease every nook and cranny of a 10-cup Bundt Cake pan with nonstick baking spray. Pour the batter into the prepared pan.",
    "Bake for about 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. I suggest checking the cake at 50 minutes to ensure it doesn't over bake.",
    "Cool cake for 15 minutes in the pan, placed on a cooking rack, before inverting the cake onto a separate cooling rack to cool completely. Once cool, flip right side up to cover with chocolate ganache.",
    "For the Chocolate Ganache:",
    "Finely chop the chocolate and place it in a small heatproof bowl. Set aside.",
    "Warm the cream over medium heat until it comes to a boil. Pour the cream over the chopped chocolate and let it sit for 1 minute, then whisk smooth. Whisk in the vanilla, if using.",
    "Slowly pour the glaze over the cake, letting it drip down the sides. Allow the glaze to set for about 30 minutes before slicing and serving!",
    "Store in an airtight container for up to 3 days, or in the fridge for up to 5 days."
