    "In a small bowl, whisk together the 2 cups flour, 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, and 1/4 teaspoon salt.",
    "In a medium mixing bowl, cream together the 1/2 cup of butter and 1 cup of sugar, until smooth. Add the two eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add the 1 teaspoon of vanilla and the 1 cup of ricotta cheese. Gradually add the dry ingredients, mixing well. Be sure to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl. Cover the bowl with some plastic wrap and refrigerate for a minimum of an hour or up to two days.",
    "When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350°F, and prepare two baking sheets by lining them with a piece of parchment.",
    "Using a #60 cookie scoop or tablespoon, place dough onto prepared cookie sheet about two inches apart. Bake for 12-14 minutes until edges are lightly golden brown. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for about 5 minutes before moving them to a wire rack to cool completely.",
    "Glaze",
    "In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and confectioners' sugar. Add the 1/4 teaspoon almond extract and gradually add the 4 tablespoons of milk until the glaze can be dripped from a spoon. Frost the completely cooled cookies by dipping them, top down, into the glaze. Allow the excess to drip off and then place them onto a wire rack. Sprinkle each cookie with the nonpareil sprinkles soon after dipping about 10 at a time. Allow the glaze to harden or set before serving or storing."
