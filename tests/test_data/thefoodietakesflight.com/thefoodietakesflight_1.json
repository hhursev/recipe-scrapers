  "description": "This Chinese Hotpot Sauce is an integral part of the hot pot experience. A lot of Chinese hot pot or shabu-shabu places offer sauce stations where you can prepare your own dipping sauce. My hot pot sauce is a rich mix of Chinese sesame paste, Chinese black vinegar, soy sauce, veg oyster sauce, sugar, chili oil, garlic, green onions, and a few other ingredients that make this sauce incredibly fragrant and tasty. Dipping pieces of cooked vegetables or tofu into this sauce is makes it so addicting.",
