    "PREPARING THE SEITAN + SAUCE",
    "Dilute the miso paste in warm water/veg broth.",
    "Mix the dry ingredients together in a large bowl. Pour the broth mixture and mix well until there are no signs of dry flour.",
    "Transfer the mixture on a flat surface. Knead for 3-4 minutes or until the seitan is bouncy — you can poke it with your finger and it should go back to its original state at once. Cover the seitan.",
    "Leave the seitan to rest for at least 15 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, prepare the sauce. Mix everything together in a small bowl and adjust to desired taste.",
    "Once the seitan has rested, transfer the seitan on a sheet of foil, flatten the seitan or shape it depending on what you like. Wrap the seitan on the foil.",
    "Steam the seitan for 15-20 mins. After steaming, carefully unwrap the seitan and slice into thin 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick pieces.",
    "CRISPY RICE",
    "Heat an 8-inch non stick pan over medium heat. Spray or add some neutral oil to lightly coat the surface.",
    "Once hot, add the rice. Using a spatula, press down on the rice to spread across the pan.",
    "Leave to cook over medium heat for 3-4 minutes or until lightly brown. Carefully flip over and repeat for the other side.",
    "LEMONGRASS SEITAN",
    "Heat a large skillet or wok over medium heat.",
    "Add oil. Once hot, add the minced shallot, garlic, and lemongrass. Stir-fry for 1 minute until aromatic. Pour the sauce and allow to come to a gentle simmer.",
    "Add the sliced seitan and leave to simmer in the sauce for 5-6 minutes until the sauce is absorbed and turns into a thin glaze consistency.",
    "TIFF'S NUOC CHAM",
    "Mix everything together. Feel free to adjust to your desired taste.",
    "TO SERVE",
    "Place the crispy rice on a plate or large bowl.",
    "Add the seitan then serve with sliced cucumber, tomatoes, cilantro, pickled carrot/radish, the vegan nuoc cham or Vietnamese sauce/dressing. Top with ginger scallion sauce and fried shallots, if desired.",
    "To enjoy, pour a generous amount of the sauce then break apart a small portion of the rice to enjoy with the other components."
