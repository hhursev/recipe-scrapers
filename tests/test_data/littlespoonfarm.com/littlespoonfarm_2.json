    "In a medium size mixing bowl, whisk the flour, sugar, ground cinnamon, salt and baking powder together. Use a cheese grater to grate the butter into the bowl. Toss the grated butter with the flour mixture with a fork to coat and separate the pieces of butter. Cut the flour into the butter using a pastry cutter or a bench scraper until the mixture comes together in pea size crumbs.",
    "In a separate bowl, whisk the grated apples, starter, egg, vanilla extract, and heavy cream until smooth. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and use a fork to gently mix. Because the grated apples release moisture, the dough will be slightly sticky.",
    "Dump the dough onto a clean work surface and use your hands to press and shape the dough into an 8\" disc shape. (Use a small amount of flour if needed to help it from sticking to the surface.)",
    "Cut the dough into 8 wedges using a bench scraper or a large knife. Arrange the wedges onto a parchment lined baking sheet with space in between each wedge. Place the baking sheet in the fridge to chill for 30 minutes.",
    "When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 400°F (204°C). Bake for 25 minutes or until the scones are golden brown. Mix the glaze ingredients and drizzle on top of the baked scones."
