    "Melt butter in a skillet over low heat. Add diced apples and spices (cinnamon/nutmeg). Cook until apples are soft, fragrant, and slightly caramelized, and juices thicken, about 5–8 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.",
    "Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Unfold the puff pastry sheet onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Cut the sheet into four equal squares.",
    "Spoon 2–3 tablespoons of the cooled apple filling onto one half of each pastry square, leaving a border. Fold the empty half over the filling to form a triangle.",
    "Use a fork to firmly crimp and seal the edges of the turnovers. Brush the tops generously with melted butter (or egg wash). Sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar (or coarse sugar).",
    "Bake for 18–22 minutes, or until the pastry is puffed and golden brown.",
    "Let cool on a wire rack for 10–15 minutes. For a glaze, whisk together powdered sugar and milk/water, then drizzle over the warm turnovers before serving."
