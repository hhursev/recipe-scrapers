    "Peel the carrots and then julienne them into little matchsticks before placing in a large bowl. Remove the ends of the snap peas and then slice them thinly before adding to the bowl. Roughly chop the herbs and then add them to the bowl as well. Finally, add the sesame seeds, salt, pepper, and the dressing to the bowl.",
    "Toss the salad to combine before transferring to your platter of choice. Peel and pit the avocado and then cut the flesh into cubes. Evenly place the avocado on top of the salad. If there’s any dressing lingering at the bottom of the bowl, spoon it over the avocado.",
    "Serve the salad right away and enjoy!"
