  "description": "This Slow Cooker Brisket Chili is one of those set-it-and-forget-it meals that feels like a warm hug in a bowl. You toss everything in, let it cook low and slow, and by dinnertime you’ve got rich, smoky, beefy chili that tastes like you worked all day – when really, your slow cooker did all the heavy lifting. Great for game day, chilly nights, or feeding a hungry crowd. Kids love it, grown-ups fight over seconds. It’s that good.",
