  "description": "This is one of those recipes I come back to again and again. It’s quick, fresh, and full of flavor. You roast everything on one pan (yes, even the onions!) and stuff it into warm pitas with a creamy, herby ranch slaw that makes the whole thing sing. It’s easy enough for a Monday but still feels a little special. No fancy ingredients. No fussy steps. Just real good food.",
