    "To make the bread pudding",
    "Dry the Bread: Preheat your smoker to 225° F (107° F). Your oven can also be used for this step.",
    "Slice the bread with a sharp serrated knife into 1” cubes.",
    "Place the bread cubes into a 13x9\" disposable aluminum roasting pan. Place into the smoker or oven until slightly dried out, about 30-45 minutes (tossing a once or twice so they dry evenly. ) Cool slightly before adding to the custard.",
    "While the bread is drying, soak raisins in 3 tbsp bourbon in a small bowl.",
    "Make the Custard: In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, cream, sugar, salt, and vanilla until dissolved.",
    "Coat the baking dish with butter or spray. Add the dried bread cubes.",
    "Drain the raisins, reserving bourbon. Add to custard. Pour over bread, pressing down to soak.",
    "For Creamier Pudding: Refrigerate 30 minutes to overnight.",
    "Pour the custard over the cubed bread, mixing and pushing down with your hands to fully submerge all of the bread.",
    "For a creamier and more flavorful bread pudding: Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or overnight to allow the bread to fully soak up the custard. (If you are in a hurry, you can skip this step, but it is much better to let it soak)",
    "Preheat smoker to 350°F (176°C). Smoke uncovered 50-70 minutes until puffed and golden brown and internal temperature reaches 170°F (76°C).",
    "Let the bread pudding cool slightly before serving with bourbon sauce or your favorite sauce.",
    "To make the bourbon sauce",
    "In a saucepan over medium heat, melt butter with brown sugar, stirring until smooth.",
    "Add reserved bourbon and cook 30 seconds.",
    "Stir in cream and cinnamon. Simmer 5 minutes, stirring frequently.",
    "Add bourbon and cook for 30 seconds before adding the cream and cinnamon. Bring to a simmer, reduce the heat and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently.",
    "Keep the sauce warm until ready to serve over bread pudding, or chill and gently re-heat when ready to serve."
