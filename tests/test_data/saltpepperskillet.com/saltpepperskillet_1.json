  "instructions_list": [
    "Prep the picanha by trimming any silver skin from the bottom side. Use a sharp knife to score the fat cap in a 1/2-inch cross-hatch pattern. This will help render the fat. Drizzle lightly with oil and generously season all over with kosher salt. Allow to sit for at least 1 hour at room temperature, or ideally refrigerate overnight.",
    "Preheat your smoker, to 250°-275°F (120°-135° C), setting up for indirect low and slow smoking. Add preferred wood chunks, chips, or pellets such as oak or hickory.",
    "Cook - Place picanha on the cool side of the smoker with a remote probe thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat. Close the lid and cook until the internal temperature reaches 115°F (46° C), about 60-90 minutes.",
    "Remove - Once at 115°F internal, remove picanha from the smoker and increase the grill's temperature to high heat for searing. Alternatively, heat a heavy skillet over high heat on the stove.",
    "Sear the picanha for about 2 minutes per side, until a nice crust forms on the exterior and the internal temperature reaches 130°-135°F (54°-57° C) for medium-rare doneness.",
    "Allow the steak to rest for 10 minutes before slicing against the grain. Sprinkle with a bit more salt before serving. Enjoy with chimichurri sauce or your favorite sauce and sides."
