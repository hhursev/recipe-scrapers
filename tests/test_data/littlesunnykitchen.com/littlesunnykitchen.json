      "reviewBody": "Super Solid marinade!!  I did 5 pounds of breast meat and marinated around 6 hours and it was more than enoughtime. I use a ceramic grill with double racks and grilled top rack at around 400 so it was quick and super juicy. The marinade has great flavor and I sliced all the chicken thin for tacos. I will also tell you that for a left over salad basic LTO with ranch dressing the left overchicken was amazing. I made it even faster as I just hand some minced garlic in water that I substituted over fresh and it worked well. 15 people devoured it."

Maybe next time I'll zest my lime to add the aromatic and extra citrus notes. This is definitely a keeper!"

      "reviewBody": "Excellent chicken marinade but leave out the optional cinnamon. I love cinnamon so I tried half of what was called for, only 1/8 tsp., But it was enough to give the marinade an off flavor that I did not care for. Without the cinnamon it would have been 5 stars. I do plan to make this again sans cinnamon!"

I used chicken breast left out the cinnamon and used fresh lemon instead of lime because that's what I had on hand.  While  I was pan frying the chicken I ended up finding a lime and squeezed some on and continued cooking.  This recipe was perfection."

      "reviewBody": "Loved this recipe, but I did spice it up a bit with 1/4tsp cayenne, omitted the cinnamon and used the sweeter Mexican Oregano.  Then, me being me (love spicy marinades) I doubled it, and cooked it in a cast iron skillet .\r\n\r\nTook just minutes to make, left it in the fridge for like 20 hours and wow!  Delicious!"
