  "ingredients": [
    "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided",
    "1 clove garlic, thinly sliced",
    "1 bunch (about 8 ounces) kale, thick stems removed and leaves shredded",
    "8 slices whole grain bread",
    "8 slices Swiss or Le Gruyère cheese (about 8 ounces total)",
    "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt",
    "1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper"
  ],
  "instructions_list": [
    "In a large skillet, heat 1 teaspoon olive oil over medium-high heat until hot.",
    "Add kale, garlic, salt and pepper. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until kale begins to wilt, about 5 minutes.",
    "Uncover, reduce heat to medium and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until kale is very soft, about 5 minutes.",
    "Arrange 4 bread slices on a work surface. Top each with one slice of cheese, an even layer of the kale, another slice of cheese, and then a piece of bread.",
    "Brush both sides of each sandwich with remaining olive oil.",
    "Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat until hot.",
    "Place stacked sandwiches in the pan and cook until bread is golden brown and cheese has melted, pressing flat with a spatula occasionally, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Serve immediately. Depending on the size of your skillet, you might need to cook these in batches. If so, the first batch can be kept warm in a 200°F oven while finishing the second batch."
