  "description": "This Cinnamon Roll Oatmeal is a naturally sweet and delicious way to start your day. It’s a date-sweetened oatmeal paired with a creamy cashew drizzle that makes for a fancy, yet simple breakfast. Less than 3 percent of Americans meet the daily recommended fiber intake, despite research suggesting that high-fiber foods, such as whole grains, can affect the progression of coronary heart disease. The soluble fiber of oatmeal forms a gel in the stomach, delaying stomach emptying, making one feel full for a longer period.",
