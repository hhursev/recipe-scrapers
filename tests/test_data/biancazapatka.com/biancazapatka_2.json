  "instructions": "Blueberry Cake\nPreheat the oven to 356 °F (180 °C). Grease a 25-cm loaf pan and line with parchment paper (see photo above).\nWhisk together the soy milk and lemon juice in a measuring cup and set aside for about 5 minutes until it has curdled into vegan buttermilk (this doesn't work well with other types of plant milks, however, it’s not a big deal when it doesn't work).\nMeanwhile, sift flour and baking powder into a large bowl. Then whisk in baking soda, salt and sugar.\nAdd vegan buttermilk, oil and vanilla extract and stir briefly until all ingredients are just combined.\nWash the blueberries, pat them dry and toss them with a little cornstarch or flour (so that they don't seep onto the bottom and lose too much juice during baking). Then gently fold ¾ of them into the batter with a spatula.\nPour the batter into the baking pan and gently tap the pan a few times on the work surface to get rid of the air bubbles and smooth out the top.\nSpread the remaining ¼ of blueberries on top and bake the cake for about 55 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean (don't skip the stick test! If the cake gets too dark during baking, cover loosely with a piece of parchment paper).\nAllow to cool in the pan for 10-15 minutes. Then remove and let cool completely on a cooling rack.\nBlueberry Frosting\nIn a mixing bowl, beat the dairy-free whipping cream with an electric hand mixer until stiff peaks form.\nIn another mixing bowl, mix the dairy-free cream cheese with powdered sugar, blueberry powder, San-apart and lemon juice until creamy. Then fold in the whipped cream.\nSpread the blueberry cream on the cake and decorate with fresh blueberries, blackberries and desiccated coconut.\nSlice and enjoy!",
