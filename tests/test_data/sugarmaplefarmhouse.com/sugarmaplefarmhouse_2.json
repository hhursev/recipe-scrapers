    "Preheat the oven to 425 degrees and remove the salmon from the refrigerator. Pat it dry on both sides and then set it aside.",
    "Wipe down a baking sheet with 2 tablespoon of the extra virgin olive oil. Place the fennel around the edges of the baking sheet and brush another 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil over the tops. Sprinkle with coarse sea salt and fresh cracked pepper. When the oven is heated, roast for 10 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, mix together the honey, melted butter, orange zest, lemon zest, orange juice, lemon juice, grated garlic, red pepper, dried oregano and fresh mint in a small bowl. Set it aside.",

    "Brush the fennel with the butter mix and spoon the rest of it over the salmon, making sure to get all of the herbs and spices. Place the other half of the lemon and orange slices on top of the salmon. Drizzle on the last tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil and then roast on the middle oven rack for 15-20 minutes.",
