<p>Sometimes you find those recipes that are Earthy, full of comforting things and just all-around delicious. Meals that become part of your regular rotation, that the whole family loves and something that can be made year-round. This Bacon &amp; Mushroom Smothered Chicken is one of those recipes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>A reason to love chicken thighs</strong></h4>
<p>For some reason, this Bacon and Mushroom Smothered Chicken recipe reminds me of my childhood. It just seems like one of those recipes a grandmother would have made, with a delicious sauce and moist, flavorful chicken. The dark meat chicken cuts &#8211; found in places like the thighs and legs &#8211; are often richer in nutrients and more flavorful. Yes, it contains a bit more fat and saturated fat than white chicken cuts. However, it’s not much. And it’s that extra fat that gives the cuts more moisture and makes them more flavorful. Due to this, boneless, skinless chicken thighs are a better choice for this recipe than breasts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When it comes to the other ingredients in the Bacon &amp; Mushroom Smothered Chicken, I kept it simple and it includes some of my favorites. Shallots, onion, fresh sage, fresh thyme sprigs, bacon, mushrooms, a touch of heavy cream and a bit of chicken broth are really all that is required to make this.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Tips for making Bacon &amp; Mushroom Smothered Chicken</h4>
<ul>
<li>This recipe calls for cooked back so factor that into the overall cook time. I make my bacon in the oven on a baking sheet (at 400 degrees for about 15-18 min) and always just cook it while my chicken is cooking. But you could make it ahead of time too to save yourself a step.</li>
<li>Chicken thighs often have skin on them so don’t skip the first step that’s all about making a slightly crispier skin on the chicken. It might be tempting to just bake it but this step is important!</li>
<li>If you are really not a mushroom person – like if you completely hate them – then you can leave them out. But I just wouldn’t recommend it.</li>
<li>Make sure to use a good, quality olive oil for this recipe.</li>
<li>When cooking the sauce it&#8217;s important to keep the heat low from start to finish to avoid burning any of the ingredients. A nice simmer is all you ever need to make this sauce cohesive.</li>
<li>I recommend using fresh herbs in this as well as some pre-jarred Italian herbs. But the fresh herbs really make the dish. Don’t forget the parsley at the end. It really brightens everything up.</li>
</ul>
