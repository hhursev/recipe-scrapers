  "title": "Six-Minute Seared Ahi Tuna Steaks",
  "ingredients": [
    "2 ahi tuna (yellowfin tuna) steaks ((about 4 oz. each, 1\" thick - see notes for thinner or thicker))",
    "2 tablespoons soy sauce",
    "1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil (see notes)",
    "1 tablespoon honey (see notes)",
    "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt",
    "1/4 teaspoon black pepper (to taste)",
    "1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper ((optional))",
    "1 tablespoon canola oil (or olive oil)",
    "green onions, toasted sesame seeds, and lime wedges (for serving (optional))"
  ],
  "instructions": "Pat the ahi tuna steaks dry with a paper towel. Place on a plate or inside a plastic bag.\nMix the soy sauce (2 tablespoons), toasted sesame oil (1 tablespoon), honey (1 tablespoon) kosher salt (1/2 teaspoon- OMIT if marinating for more than a couple hours, see notes), pepper (1/4 teaspoon), and cayenne pepper (1/4 teaspoon) until honey is fully dissolved. Pour over the ahi tuna steaks and turn over to coat completely. Optional: allow to marinate for at least 10 minutes, or up to overnight in the refrigerator. Also optional: Reserve a spoonful or two of the marinade before coating the fish for drizzling on top after you've cooked it.\nHeat a medium skillet (preferably non-stick or a well-seasoned cast iron skillet) on medium-high to high until very hot ( or medium medium-high for nonstick). I recommend giving cast iron 3-5 minutes to get hot and nonstick about 1 minute, depending on how thick it is.\nAdd the canola oil (1 tablespoon) to the hot pan. Sear the tuna for 1 - 1½ minutes on each side for medium rare ( 2 -2½ minutes for medium-well to well, 30 seconds for very rare. See notes - this will vary based on thickness of the tuna steaks). (Note: different burners get hotter depending on your stove. Use your best judgement whether you use medium, medium-high, or high heat, as the marinade may burn if too high heat is used)\nRemove to a cutting board. Slice into 1/2 inch slices and serve garnished with green onions, toasted sesame seeds, and a squeeze of fresh lime juice, if desired.",
