  "ingredients": [
    "1 cup ghee (or two sticks butter or vegan butter), softened",
    "1 cup coconut sugar (you can also use white sugar)",
    "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
    "2 egg yolks, beaten",
    "¼ teaspoon sea salt",
    "2 2/3 cups gluten-free baking flour (I used Bob’s Red Mill 1-to-1 Gluten Free Baking Flour)",
    "1 cup no-added sugar strawberry, raspberry, or apricot jam"
  ],
  "instructions_list": [
    "Preheat your oven to 350°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.",
    "In a large bowl, combine the ghee or butter and the sugar. Use a mixer to beat together the ingredients until they are fluffy.",
    "Add the vanilla and egg yolks and mix until combined.",
    "Add the salt and ½ cup of the flour to the mixture and mix until the flour is incorporated into the dough. Keep adding the flour in ½ cup increments until you have added all of the flour and it is mixed well with the other ingredients.",
    "Then, use your hands or a spoon to roll the dough into balls. Each ball should be about a tablespoon of the dough.",
    "Flatten each dough ball onto the baking sheets, using your thumb to form an indentation into each cookie.",
    "After you have formed all of the cookies, add two teaspoons of jam into the indentation of each cookie.",
    "Bake the cookies for 16-18 minutes, or until they have started to turn a golden brown. Let the cookies cool slightly before serving."
