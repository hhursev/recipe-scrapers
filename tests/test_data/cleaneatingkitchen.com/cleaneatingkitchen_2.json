    "In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the coconut milk, ¼ cup of sugar, agar agar powder, and vanilla extract. Whisk the ingredients to ensure that the powder and sugar get completely dissolved.",
    "Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and simmer the mixture for at least 3 minutes. This ensures that the agar agar powder gets activated.",
    "Then, remove the saucepan from the heat and pour the mixture into four small bowls, parfait glasses, or ramekins. Do your best to divide the mixture evenly between the containers.",
    "Place the bowls into the refrigerator for at least 2 hours to set.",
    "When you are ready to serve the panna cotta, make the strawberry sauce. In a small saucepan, combine the frozen strawberries, water, 1 tablespoon of sugar, and lemon juice.",
    "While the mixture comes up to a simmer, use the back of a serving spoon to gently smash the frozen strawberries. Let the strawberries cook for a few minutes, or until they are completely soft. Remove the saucepan from the heat.",
    "Serve the panna cotta in the bowls or molds, with a spoonful of the strawberry sauce on top of each one.",
    "You can also remove the panna cotta from the molds to a plate for serving.",
    "Enjoy immediately."
