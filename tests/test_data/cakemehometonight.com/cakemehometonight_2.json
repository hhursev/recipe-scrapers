    "Chocolate Cake",
    "Preheat the oven to 350℉. Prepare three 7-inch round cake pans with nonstick cookie spray and parchment paper circles.",
    "In a large mixing bowl, whisk the all-purpose flour, granulated sugar, dark cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt until well combined. Pour in the milk, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla extract and whisk until combined. Add in the boiling water or hot coffee and whisk the cake batter until is is combined and smooth.",
    "Divide the cake batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Bake the cake layers for 25-30 minutes, until the cake springs back when gently touched. Remove the cake pans from the oven. Cool the cake layers in the pans for about 15 minutes before removing and transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.",
    "Creamy Chocolate Buttercream Frosting",
    "In a microwave-safe bowl, heat the semisweet chocolate chips in 15 second intervals, stirring in between each interval, until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Set aside to cool to room temperature.",
    "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the room temperature butter for 5 minutes until it is pale and creamy. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl as needed.",
    "Add half of the powdered sugar and mix on low until combined. Add the remaining half of the powdered sugar and mix well. Add the melted chocolate, dark cocoa powder, vanilla extract, and salt and continue to mix on low until combined.",
    "Drizzle in the heavy cream. Turn the mixer to medium speed and whip the chocolate buttercream frosting for about 2 to 3 minutes until it is smooth and creamy.",
    "Raspberry Filling (Make Ahead)",
    "In a medium saucepan, combine the frozen raspberries, granulated sugar, and lemon juice. Cook over medium-low heat stirring occasionally until the raspberries are broken down and the mixture is bubbling.",
    "In a small separate bowl, mix together the cornstarch and water until smooth. Remove the saucepan from the heat and add the cornstarch slurry. Mix well until the raspberry filling is thickened.",
    "Run the raspberry filling through a fine mesh strainer to remove the seeds. Press the filling through the strainer with a rubber spatula. Cool the raspberry filling to room temperature and then chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours to thicken.",
    "Assembling the Chocolate Raspberry Cake",
    "Level the cooled chocolate cake layers with a serrated knife.",
    "Place one cake layer on a round cake board. Add a small amount of chocolate buttercream to the top of the layer and spread evenly with an offset spatula. Use a piping bag with the tip cut off filled with chocolate frosting to pipe a border of the frosting around the edge of the cake. Spread half of the raspberry filling onto the cake layer.",
    "Add the next cake layer and repeat the same process above with the second layer. Then, add the final cake layer to the top of the cake, bottom side facing up.",
    "With an offset spatula, add a crumb coat, a thin layer of frosting, to the top and sides of the cake. Use a cake scraper to remove excess frosting to smooth the sides. Chill the cake for 20 minutes to firm the frosting.",
    "Spread a generous layer of the chocolate buttercream onto the chilled cake with an offset spatula. Use a scalloped cake scraper to remove the excess frosting and create a pattern in the buttercream. Chill for an additional 20 minutes.",
    "Use piping bags fitted with Ateco 869 and Wilton 4B piping tips to decorate the top of the cake with additional buttercream. Decorate with fresh raspberries."
