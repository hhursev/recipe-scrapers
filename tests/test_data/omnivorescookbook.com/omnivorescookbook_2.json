  "title": "Beef Pan-Fried Noodles",
  "ingredients": [
    "8 oz (225 g) flank steak (or skirt steak) , thinly sliced against the grain",
    "8 oz (225 g) fresh Hong Kong pan fry noodles (or other type of thin noodles) (Footnote 1)",
    "2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry)",
    "2 teaspoons cornstarch",
    "1/4 teaspoon salt",
    "1 cup low-sodium beef broth",
    "2 tablespoons soy sauce (*Footnote 2)",
    "2 tablespoons oyster sauce",
    "1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry)",
    "2 tablespoons cornstarch",
    "1 teaspoon sugar",
    "1/4 teaspoon Chinkiang vinegar",
    "1/4 teaspoon white pepper",
    "4 tablespoons peanut oil , divided",
    "4 heads baby bok choy , quartered",
    "4 cloves garlic , minced",
    "1 inch (2.5 cm) ginger , minced",
    "1/2 yellow onion , sliced",
    "1/2 carrot , sliced into strips"
  ],
  "instructions": "Combine the beef and the marinade ingredients in a medium-sized bowl. Toss with your hands to coat the beef evenly and let marinate while preparing other ingredients.\nCombine the sauce ingredients in a medium-sized bowl and stir to mix thoroughly.\nPrepare the noodles according to package directions (*Footnote 3). Drain and set aside in a colander to dry.\nHeat a large heavy-bottomed pan (nonstick or carbon steel) with 2 tablespoons of peanut oil over medium-high heat until hot. Spread the noodles into a patty shape (*Footnote 4). Cook without flipping until the bottoms turn golden. Turn the noodles to fry the other side until golden. Drizzle in a bit more oil to help with the frying, if needed. Once done, transfer the noodles to a big serving plate.\nPour 1 tablespoon of oil into the same pan. Add the beef and spread it out in a single layer using a pair of tongs or chopsticks. Let cook undisturbed for 30 seconds or so, or until the bottom turns golden brown. Flip to cook the other side until browned. Stir a few times until the beef is cooked (it’s OK if there’s a hint of pink inside), transfer to a big plate, and set aside.\nAdd the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil to the pan. Add the onion and carrots. Quickly stir a few times to mix well. Add the ginger and garlic. Stir and cook for 30 seconds to release the fragrance.\nAdd the bok choy. Cook and stir for another minute, until the veggies start to soften.\nStir the sauce thoroughly to dissolve the cornstarch completely and pour the sauce into the pan. Stir and cook to bring the sauce to a boil, and cook until it starts to thicken.\nAdd the cooked beef back into the pan. Stir to mix everything well. Once the sauce reaches the desired consistency, pour everything over the fried noodles. (*Footnote 5)\nServe immediately as a main dish.",
