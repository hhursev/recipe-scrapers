  "ingredients": [
    "2-3 scallions",
    "2 (5-ounce) cans tuna, packed in olive oil or water",
    "2 teaspoons black sesame seeds",
    "1 teaspoon white sesame seeds",
    "2 teaspoons sriracha*",
    "2 teaspoons unseasoned rice vinegar",
    "2-3 tablespoons Olive Oil Mayo",
    "1 small avocado",
    "1/2 seedless cucumber",
    "3 sheets nori",
    "*replace with Louisiana hot sauce for Whole30"
  ],
  "instructions_list": [
    "Mix the tuna. Thinly slice the scallion cross-wise and place in a mixing bowl. Drain the tuna and add to the bowl, along with the sesame seeds, sriracha, and vinegar. Mix with a fork until combined. Then add the mayo and mix well.",
    "Prep the veggies. Cut the avocado and cucumber into 3- to 4-inch long matchsticks. Set aside.",
    "Roll it up. Cut the nori sheets in half crosswise to make two rectangles; you can follow the direction of the lines stamped on the nori. Lay a sheet of nori on your work surface. Place a scant 1/4 cup tuna on the edge closest to you, leaving a 1/2-inch border at the end near you. Flatten it out a bit, then a few strips of cucumber and avocado on top. Starting from the bottom left, roll toward the right to make a cone, tucking the ingredients inside as you go, then moisten the free edge with a little water or sriracha to seal it. Repeat with the remaining tuna and nori.",
    "To serve, place on individual plates with raw veggies on the side."
