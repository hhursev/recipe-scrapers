  "instructions_list": [
    "Prep. Preheat the oven to 200F and cover a baking sheet with parchment paper.",
    "Make the batter. Crack the eggs in a bowl and beat them until smooth and frothy. Add the vanilla and cinnamon. Stir again and set aside.",
    "Mash the bananas. In another bowl, mash the bananas with a fork or potato masher until smooth; they should have the consistency of pudding and no big lumps. Add the bananas to the egg batter and mix until well combined. The batter will be pretty liquidy, and that is OK.",
    "Cook the pancakes. Place a little ghee or coconut oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, 2 minutes. You’ll make two pancakes at once: Place 2 tablespoons of batter in the pan and use the tablespoon to create a 3-4 inch circle; repeat. Cook the pancakes until bubbles appear around the edge, 1-2 minutes, but the middle is still a bit jiggly; flip with a very thin spatula and cook the other side for 1 minute. Remove and repeat. Place the pancakes in the oven to stay warm while you cook the sausage.",
    "Cook the sausage. In a large mixing bowl, combine all of the sausage ingredients and mix well with your hands to combine. Scoop 1/4-cupfuls of the meat and flatten into patties, about 1/4-inch thick. Press your thumb into the top of the patties to make a small indentation so they don’t turn bulbous when you cook them. Reheat the skillet you used for the pancakes, 3 minutes over medium-high heat. Cook the patties 3 minutes undisturbed, then flip and cook another 2-3 minutes until nicely browned and cooked through.",
    "To serve, pile pancakes on the plate along with sausages and add your favorite toppings."
