  "ingredients": [
    "8-12 ounces Italian sausage (sugar-free for Whole30)",
    "4 ounces Applegate Naturals Pork & Beef Pepperoni (omit for Whole30)",

    "Cook the meats. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, 3 minutes. While it warms, cut the sausage into coins. Place the sausage coins in the skillet and cook undisturbed, 2 minutes. Flip them and cook another 2 minutes so both sides are browned. Add the pepperoni to the pan and toss the meats together. Cut the tomatoes in half lengthwise and add them to the skillet. Toss and cook 5-7 minutes, until the tomatoes are lightly browned and little collapsed.",
    "Cook the eggs. Crack the eggs the eggs into the pan one at a time. Try not to break the yolks and then tilt the pan to allow the egg white to coat the meats and tomatoes. Julienne the basil and sprinkle on top of the eggs, along with the salt and pepper. Reduce the heat to medium, cover the pan with a lid, and cook until the eggs are set and cooked to your preferred level of doneness: about 1-2 minutes for runny yolks, 2-3 minutes for gelled yolks, and 3-4 minutes for well done.",
    "To serve, cut the “pizza” into wedges."
