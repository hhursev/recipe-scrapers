Recommend using a 12-cup food processor, or you can process the ingredients in batches and then mix everything together in a large mixing bowl.\nCombine whole tomatoes, Rotel, onion, jalapeno, garlic, sugar, salt, cumin, lime juice, and cilantro in a blender or food processor. Pulse until you get the salsa to the consistency you’d like—I do about 10 to 15 pulses. Test seasonings with a tortilla chip and adjust as needed.\nRefrigerate salsa for at least an hour. Serve with tortilla chips or cheese nachos.",
