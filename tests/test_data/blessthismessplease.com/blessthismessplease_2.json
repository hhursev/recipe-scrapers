    "Make the Dough",
    "Mix 3 cups of the flour with the salt, yeast, sugar, and ginger in a large bowl and create a well in the center.",
    "Add the egg, butter, milk, molasses, and ½ cup of water to the dry ingredients. Mix until combined.",
    "Add the remaining cup of flour and mix until combined, adding more water as needed, up to 1 cup, to reach a not-to-sticky dough consistency.",
    "Cover and let dough rest for 10 minutes.",
    "On a floured surface, turn out the dough and knead until it comes together and is smooth, about 6-8 minutes by hand or 4 minutes in a stand mixer.",
    "Assemble the Cinnamon Rolls",
    "Combine the brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger and salt for the filling.",
    "Roll out dough into a rectangle, about 1/4-inch thick.",
    "Spread softened butter evenly over the top of the dough.",
    "Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar mixture over the top of the dough and spread it out evenly. Press lightly to adhere the cinnamon sugar mixture to the butter.",
    "Roll the rectangle up tightly from the long side so that you have a long rolled log.",
    "Cut the log into 12-15 even rolls. This is most easily done by dividing the dough into 4 pieces and then each of the 4 pieces into three pieces (for 12 cinnamon rolls). Or divide the dough into 3 pieces and then each of the 3 pieces into 5 pieces (for 15 cinnamon rolls). To cut the dough, use a serrated knife or plain dental floss placed under the dough log and crossed at the top to cut the dough into rolls.",
    "For rolls with soft sides, place them 1/2-inch apart on a sheet tray, in a pie plate, or in a cast iron skillet. For rolls that do not touch, place 1-½ inches apart. Be sure to grease whatever you use to bake them in.",
    "Cover rolls and let rest for 15 minutes.",
    "Uncover and bake at 350°F for about 20 minutes, until the tops just barely start to turn golden and the center cinnamon roll is cooked through.",
    "Make the Icing",
    "Combine cream cheese and butter until smooth.",
    "Add vanilla extract and mix well.",
    "Add in half of the powdered sugar and the milk, mixing until smooth.",
    "Add in the rest of the powdered sugar until your desired consistency is reached. I like the icing to be thick but pourable.",
    "Pour icing over rolls as soon as they are removed from the oven."
