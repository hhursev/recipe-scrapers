  "instructions": "Before You Start...\nJapanese short-grain white rice requires a soaking time of 20–30 minutes. The rice-to-water ratio is 1 to 1.1 (or 1.2) for short-grain white rice. Please note that 2¼ cups (450 g, 3 rice cooker cups) of uncooked Japanese short-grain rice yield 6⅔ cups (990 g) of cooked white rice. This is enough for 9 onigiri rice balls (typically 110 g each). Optional: To make 5–6 rice balls, cook 1½ cups (300 g, 2 rice cooker cups) of uncooked Japanese short-grain rice in 1⅔ cups water (400 ml) to yield 4⅓ cups (660 g) of cooked white rice.\nCook the rice; see how with a rice cooker, pot over the stove, Instant Pot, or donabe. To my rice cooker, I added 2½ cups water to 2¼ cups uncooked Japanese short-grain white rice. Once the rice is cooked, gather all the ingredients.\nTo Season the Rice\nCombine 3 Tbsp soy sauce and 1 Tbsp sugar in a small bowl and microwave until the mixture is hot, about 30–60 seconds. Whisk it all together until the sugar dissolves.\nAdd 1 Tbsp roasted sesame oil and ¼ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt and mix it all together.\nTransfer the hot cooked rice to a large bowl and add the seasoning mixture.\nWith a rice paddle, use a slicing motion to combine the seasoning and cooked rice well. Now, you‘re ready to shape the rice balls. Note: Be sure to let the cooked rice cool a little bit until you can hold it without burning your hands. Rice must be hot or warm when making onigiri in order to hold its shape.\nTo Shape the Rice Balls\nWith an Onigiri Mold: Prepare a small bowl filled with water. Soak the onigiri mold and lid in the water to moisten so the rice doesn‘t stick to it. Remove the mold and drain the excess water.\nFill the onigiri mold with the hot seasoned rice all the way to the top edge, making sure to fill the corners. Cover with the lid and push down firmly. You should feel a slight resistance; if not, you may want to add a bit more rice.\nRemove the lid. Flip over the mold onto a baking sheet or plate lined with parchment paper. Then, push the “button” on the mold‘s bottom to release your onigiri. Tip: Always dip your fingers in water before touching the onigiri to prevent the rice from sticking to them.\nRepeat with the remaining rice.\nNow, firmly hand-press the rice balls to keep them from falling apart while grilling. For Yaki Onigiri, you‘ll want to press the rice ball a bit more tightly than you would a regular onigiri. First, moisten both palms with a bit of water to prevent the rice from sticking. Then, pick up a rice ball in your left (non-dominant) hand. Place your right (dominant) hand on top of the rice in a “mountain\" shape and gently press the triangle corner. At the same time, squeeze the fingers and heel of your bottom (left) hand to gently press the sides flat.Now, rotate the triangle corner you just pressed toward you (clockwise, if you‘re right-handed). The tip of the second corner will now be pointing up. Repeat the above “press and rotate” steps to hand press the second triangle corner and then the third, always keeping your left hand on the bottom and your right hand on top. Press and rotate a final 2–3 more times to finish.\nIn the image below, the top row is hand pressed while the bottom row is not.\nIf you don‘t want to touch the rice with your hands, you can press the onigiri with plastic wrap. Place a piece of plastic wrap on the working surface, wet your fingers, and place the onigiri in the middle.\nGather the corners of the plastic wrap and twist it a few times to tighten it around the rice. Form the rice into a triangle shape in the same manner that I described above.\nWithout an Onigiri Mold: You also can use plastic wrap to shape the onigiri instead of using a mold. Place a piece of plastic film on the working surface, wet your fingers, and put the rice on top. Gather the corners of the plastic film and twist it a few times to tighten it around the rice.\nForm the rice into a triangle shape through the plastic in the same manner that I described above for hand-pressing the onigiri. Repeat with the remaining rice. Tip: To shape the onigiri with your hands the traditional way, see the step-by-step instructions and images in my Onigiri (Japanese Rice Balls) post.\nTo Pan-Grill the Onigiri\nCombine 1 Tbsp soy sauce and 1 tsp roasted sesame oil for the glaze. Place a sheet of parchment paper on a large frying pan.\nGently place the rice balls on the parchment paper and grill on medium-low heat. Grill the onigiri until all sides are crispy and lightly browned. Once browned on the bottom, turn them over (I use two silicone spatulas). Don’t flip them until browned; work on one side at a time and avoid handling them too much, which may cause the onigiri to break into pieces.\nRotate the onigiri to grill all sides and make sure they become crispy.\nOnce they are nicely toasted and lightly brown, turn the heat to low (or turn off the heat). Brush the onigiri sides with the soy sauce glaze, then turn over to grill on the sauce side. Then, brush on the other side.\nBe careful not to burn the onigiri after you brush it with the glaze. Optionally, you can brush them with my homemade unagi sauce and teriyaki sauce. Your Yaki Onigiri are now ready to enjoy.\nTo Store\nRice gets hard when you refrigerate it. You can individually wrap the Yaki Onigiri in plastic wrap and cover them with a thick kitchen towel and store in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. The towel will prevent the rice from getting too cold and keep the food cool but not cold. You can also store the Yaki Onigiri that are individually plastic-wrapped in the freezer for up to a month. When you‘re ready to eat, bring it back to room temperature and reheat in a microwave or frying pan.",
