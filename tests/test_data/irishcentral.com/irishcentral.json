    "John Howard was quite possibly Ireland's first celebrity chef. For 25 years he and his wife, Catherine, ran Le Coq Hardi restaurant, in Dublin 4, in 1977. It was one of the best-known dining locations in the country. Le Coq Hardi was known for its great food, expensive wine and for being where the captains of industry dined on lavish expense accounts mixed in with a little hanky panky.",
    "In early 2000, he retired, sold the premises to a wine company, and moved to Spain to consult with Bord Bia."
