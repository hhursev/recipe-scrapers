  "title": "Apple Pie Filling Recipe",
  "ingredients": [
    "3 lbs apples (a variety of sweet & tart (honeycrisp, braeburn, macoun, Cortland, pink lady, etc.))",
    "1 lemon",
    "¾ cup granulated sugar",
    "½ cup light brown sugar (packed)",
    "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon",
    "1 tablespoon cornstarch",
    "2 tablespoons unsalted butter (cubed)"
  ],
  "instructions_list": [
    "Peel, core, and slice apples to about 1/8th inch thick. Place the apples in a large bowl.",
    "Zest the lemon over the apples and then squeeze the juice into the bowl of apples.",
    "Add the granulated white sugar, light brown sugar, and cinnamon to the apples. Toss together with a spoon until each apple slice has an even coating.",
    "Add the apple mixture and any accumulated juices in a large saucepan or Dutch oven. Cook on medium heat.",
    "Cook until the apples are crisp but tender. They will be softened but not mushy, opaque, and have a little crunch.",
    "In a small bowl, whisk together cornstarch and one tablespoon of water. Pour it into the hot filling while you stir.",
    "After adding the cornstarch, allow the filling to boil for 1 minute. This will immediately thicken the filling. When you add the cornstarch slurry, the filling will turn white, and you will know it’s cooked when it becomes opaque again. Add the butter for a silky finish.",
    "Pour the filling onto a parchment paper-lined deep baking sheet or dish.",
    "Refrigerate until the filling has cooled completely. Once cold, transfer to clean jars or another airtight container, or fill your favorite pie crust and bake that apple pie!"
