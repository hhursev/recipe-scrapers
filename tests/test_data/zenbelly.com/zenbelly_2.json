    "for the fish",
    "In a medium bowl, combine the marinade ingredients (coconut milk, lime juice, garlic, salt, onion powder, and oregano.",
    "Slice the fish into strips about 1-inch wide and add to the bowl. Set aside while you prep the rest of the tacos, or around 30 minutes.",
    "After the fish has marinaded, set up a dredging station – a wide shallow bowl or plate with the flour, and an empty plate to place the dredged fish. Pull the fish out of the marinade, allowing the excess to drip off and roll in the flour.",
    "Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add a good layer of oil. Once it’s shimmering, add the fish and cook for a minute or two on each side, or until browned on all sides and cooked through. Remove to a wire rack-lined baking sheet or several layers of paper towels.",
    "Assemble tacos by placing a couple pieces of the fish on a warmed tortilla and top with slaw, salsa, and sliced avocado"
