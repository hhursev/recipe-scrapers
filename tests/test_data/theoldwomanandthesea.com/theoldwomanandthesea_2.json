Add the garlic, ginger, and jalapeño and sauté an additional minute. Stir in the tomato paste and water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and let simmer for 10 minutes or until the sauce has started to thicken slightly. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly before add the sauce to a blender or food processor. Process until smooth.",
