Low-calorie option - Spritz with baking spray and toast tortillas under the broiler.\nIn the same pan and oil, fry the eggs sunny side up basting them with oil as needed. Low-calorie option - Poach the eggs in water.\nPlace the cooked eggs over the tortillas and spoon the warmed sauce over the whites. Top with some crumbling cheese and cilantro. Serve with seasoned pintos beans if you would like! Slice the yolk open and mix with the sauce to enjoy.",
