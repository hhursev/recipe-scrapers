    "Heat the salsa ranchera in the microwave or a pan until warmed through.",
    "Set a pan over medium-high heat and add a little bit of oil. Once hot, lightly fry the corn tortillas similar to enchiladas where they are still malleable or until crisp. Drain on a paper towel. Low-calorie option - Spritz with baking spray and toast tortillas under the broiler.",

    "Place the cooked eggs over the tortillas and spoon the warmed sauce over the whites. Top with some crumbling cheese and cilantro. Serve with seasoned pintos beans if you would like! Slice the yolk open and mix with the sauce to enjoy."
