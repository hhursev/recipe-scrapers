That's fine!\nNext, place your spuds in a nice cool water bath. Completely submerge the fries in water.\nLet fries sit one hour. This helps to remove excess starch and will help the fries crisp up more in the oven.\nPreheat air fryer to 375 degrees.\nAfter an hour, drain the water, and pat fries dry with a paper towel.\nToss with a couple tablespoons of olive oil, salt and pepper.\nAdd fries to bottom of air fryer basket, making sure they are all on the same level (don't stack them on top of each other.)\nCook 15-20 minutes, until crispy and golden brown.\nPlace on a baking sheet lined with paper towels and a cooling rack over it.\nPlace in warm oven (set to the minimum temperature, not over 250 degrees) and let rest while other batches of fries are cooking.\nServe hot and enjoy.",
