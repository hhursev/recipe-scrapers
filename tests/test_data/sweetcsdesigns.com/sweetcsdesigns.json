    "3 large russet potatoes",
    "2-3 tablespoons olive oil",

  "instructions_list": [
    "Using a mandoline, slice the potatoes into fries. I don't worry too much about the size of fry I am making- some are bigger, and some are smaller. That's fine!",
    "Next, place your spuds in a nice cool water bath. Completely submerge the fries in water.",
    "Let fries sit one hour. This helps to remove excess starch and will help the fries crisp up more in the oven.",
    "Preheat air fryer to 375 degrees.",
    "After an hour, drain the water, and pat fries dry with a paper towel.",
    "Toss with a couple tablespoons of olive oil, salt and pepper.",
    "Add fries to bottom of air fryer basket, making sure they are all on the same level (don't stack them on top of each other.)",
    "Cook 15-20 minutes, until crispy and golden brown.",
    "Place on a baking sheet lined with paper towels and a cooling rack over it.",
    "Place in warm oven (set to the minimum temperature, not over 250 degrees) and let rest while other batches of fries are cooking.",
    "Serve hot and enjoy."
