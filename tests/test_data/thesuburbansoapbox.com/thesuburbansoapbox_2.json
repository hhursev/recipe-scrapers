    "Heat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line a 9-inch square metal pan with a parchment sling and lightly grease.",
    "In a large bowl, whisk flour, both sugars, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, and salt. Stir in the melted butter until large clumps form (use a fork to encourage chunky bits). Fold in nuts if using. Refrigerate while you mix the batter, this keeps the crumb crumblier.",
    "In a large bowl, whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and pumpkin pie spice. In a second bowl, whisk melted butter, eggs, pumpkin, sour cream, milk (and espresso powder if using), and vanilla until smooth. Pour the wet ingredients into dry ingredients and gently fold just until you no longer see dry streaks.",
    "Spread half the batter into the bottom of the pan. Sprinkle about a third of the crumb mixture evenly over the batter. Dollop and spread the remaining batter on top (the batter is thick, an offset spatula helps). Top with the remaining crumb mixture and lightly press it into the top of the cake to help it stick.",
    "Transfer the cake to the oven. Bake for 38-46 minutes or until a tester comes out with just a few moist crumbs (or an internal temp around 205°F/96°C in the center of the cake with an instant read thermometer). If the top is browning too quickly, tent loosely with foil for the last 10 minutes.",
    "Cool the cake in the pan set on a wire rack for 20-30 minutes. Beat the cream cheese until smooth, then beat in the powdered sugar, vanilla, and salt. Add milk, a teaspoon at a time, until it’s thick, yet pourable. Drizzle generously over the warm cake.",
    "Slice and serve warm or at room temp."
