  "description": "Turns out, achieving an almost 'deep fried' cauliflower result without actually deep frying cauliflower - not so easy! But, lucky",
  "ingredients": [
    "CRISPY CAULIFLOWER: 1 head cauliflower",
    "CRISPY CAULIFLOWER: 3 - 4 tablespoons hulled tahini",
    "CRISPY CAULIFLOWER: 1/2 cup plant-based milk (I used oat)",
    "CRISPY CAULIFLOWER: 2 teaspoons garlic powder",
    "CRISPY CAULIFLOWER: 1/4 teaspoon salt",
    "CRISPY CAULIFLOWER: 1 teaspoon each smoked paprika, ground cumin, chilli powder",
    "CHIPOTLE MAYO: 1 cup raw cashews",
    "CHIPOTLE MAYO: juice of 1 lemon",
    "CHIPOTLE MAYO: 2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar",
    "CHIPOTLE MAYO: 2 teaspoons garlic powder",
    "CHIPOTLE MAYO: 1/4 teaspoon salt",
    "CHIPOTLE MAYO: 1 tablespoon store bought chipotle sauce or spices of choice"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Preheat oven to 180 degrees celsius fan-forced (200 degrees for conventional ovens).",
    "Cover cashews in boiling water and set aside to soak while you prepare the cauliflower.",
    "For the cauliflower, combine all ingredients except your cauliflower in a bowl or jug and blend together using a stick blender until super smooth and creamy.",
    "Break cauliflower into florets.",
    "Coat cauliflower florets in the batter.",
    "Line two baking trays with baking paper. Spread the cauliflower over the two trays and bake for 40 minutes or until golden and crispy.",
    "While your cauliflower cooks, make the chipotle mayo by draining and rinsing your cashews. Add these to a blender with 1/3 cup water and the remainder of the chipotle mayo ingredients. Blend until super smooth and creamy. (You could also use a stick blender for this part, however a high power blender will be more likely to achieve a smooth consistency).",
    "Heat tortillas. Either assemble tacos by layering the different elements or this recipe also makes a great serve-yourself share meal!",
    "Enjoy!"
