  "ingredients": [
    "3 cups all-purpose flour (sifted)",
    "1 ½ cups sugar",
    "½ teaspoon salt",
    "1 tablespoons ground cinnamon",
    "1 teaspoon baking soda",
    "¼ teaspoon ground clove (optional)",
    "1 teaspoon baking powder",
    "1 ¼ cup oil (vegetable or canola oil will work)",
    "2 tablespoons pure vanilla extract",
    "4 eggs",
    "3 cups green apple (finely chopped (from about 2 large apples))",
    "1 cup golden raisins (optional)",
    "1 cup chopped pecans ((or walnuts) optional)"
  ],
  "instructions_list": [
    "Mix ingredients. Start by heating your oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit. Next, grease your baking dish. You can use baking spray with flour or simply coat your pan with butter and flour. In a large bowl, mix dry ingredients: flour, sugar, salt, cinnamon, clove (optional), baking soda, and baking powder. Using a large spoon or spatula, mix in oil, vanilla, and eggs. Once dry and wet ingredients are well blended, add chopped apples, raisins (optional), and chopped nuts. Mix again until all of the ingredients are well-incorporated.",
    "Bake. Add mixture to a greased baking dish, leaving 1-inch of space from the top because the bread will rise. I typically have to use two loaf pans for this bread. Smooth out the mixture to ensure that it bakes evenly. Bake for one hour, or until you are able to insert a toothpick into the middle of the bread and it comes out clean. At this point, the top of your bread should be somewhat crispy, but the inside will remain moist. Allow to cool, and then slowly invert the bread onto a separate dish. Use a knife to loosen the edges before flipping it, if necessary.",
    "Serve and enjoy. Serve with a dusting of powdered sugar, chopped pecans, and sliced apples, if desired."
