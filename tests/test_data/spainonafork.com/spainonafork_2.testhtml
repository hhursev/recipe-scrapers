To make the salmon meatballs, I used canned salmon. You can also use fresh or frozen salmon if you like. Just fully cook through and then using a fork, break the salmon down into small pieces.</p>
<p><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16844" src="https://i0.wp.com/spainonafork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image2-84-33.png?resize=531%2C800&#038;ssl=1" alt="Salmon Meatballs with Potatoes" width="531" height="800" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/spainonafork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image2-84-33.png?w=531&amp;ssl=1 531w, https://i0.wp.com/spainonafork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image2-84-33.png?resize=199%2C300&amp;ssl=1 199w, https://i0.wp.com/spainonafork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image2-84-33.png?resize=398%2C600&amp;ssl=1 398w" sizes="(max-width: 531px) 100vw, 531px" /><br />
For the potatoes, I used baby gold potatoes. You can also use regular-sized potatoes if you like. Either way, make sure to use potatoes that are a bit more waxy than starchy. As they hold their shape better when being boiled.</p>
<p><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16845" src="https://i0.wp.com/spainonafork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image0-99-44.png?resize=531%2C800&#038;ssl=1" alt="Salmon Meatballs with Potatoes" width="531" height="800" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/spainonafork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image0-99-44.png?w=531&amp;ssl=1 531w, https://i0.wp.com/spainonafork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image0-99-44.png?resize=199%2C300&amp;ssl=1 199w, https://i0.wp.com/spainonafork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image0-99-44.png?resize=398%2C600&amp;ssl=1 398w" sizes="(max-width: 531px) 100vw, 531px" /><br />
<strong>TIPS &amp; TRICKS</strong> <strong>to Make this Recipe: </strong>The secret to this recipe is to ensure the salmon mixture is well-binded. That way, the meatballs don´t fall apart. Once you have the mixture ready, make sure to squeeze it in your hands before shaping the meatballs.</p>
