    "Drain the cans of salmon into a fine sieve with a bowl underneath, gently flake the salmon, then add into a large bowl, along with the bread crumbs, crack in the eggs, add in the onion, carrot, garlic, parsley and paprika, then season with sea salt & black pepper and mix together",
    "Once everything is well mixed, mash down on the mixture until you get a paste-like texture, to shape the meatballs, grab a spoonful of the mixture and squeeze it in your hands, then shape into a ball, about the size of a golf ball, if you see your mixture is too dry to work with add in some whisked egg, if it's too wet, add in more bread crumbs",
    "Once all the salmon meatballs have been assembled, heat a large fry pan with a medium heat and add in the olive oil",
    "After a couple of minutes add in the salmon meatballs, all in a single layer and evenly spaced out, fry for 8 to 10 minutes or until golden fried all around",
    "While the salmon meatballs are cooking, cut the potatoes (washed & patted dry) into small bite-size pieces, then add them into a stock pot, all in a flat layer, fill with some water, just enough to barely cover the potatoes, season generously with sea salt and heat with a high heat",
    "While the potatoes are cooking, move back to the salmon meatballs, after 8 to 10 minutes and they're golden fried all around, remove them from the pan and set aside",
    "Now using the same pan with the same heat, make the sauce, add in the chopped onion and garlic, mix continuously, after 3 to 4 minutes and the onion is translucent, add in the flour, mix continuously, after 2 minutes add in the vinegar, thyme and season with sea salt & black pepper, quickly mix together, then slowly add in the broth while mixing continuously, once all the broth has been added and you've ended up with a slightly creamy sauce, add the salmon meatballs back into the pan, then gently flip each one so they're coated in all that goodness, lower to a low medium heat and simmer",
    "After boiling the potatoes for 15 to 20 minutes and they're just cooked through, you can always pierce them with a toothpick, drain into a colander",
    "Transfer the potatoes into serving dishes, along with some of the simmering salmon meatballs, then top off with some of the sauce and chopped fresh parsley, enjoy!"
