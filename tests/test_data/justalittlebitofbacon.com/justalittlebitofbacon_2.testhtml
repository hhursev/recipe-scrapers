Swordfish is one of my favorites for the grill. It's so meaty and satisfying. I also like it cooked to 130 so it's opaque but still juicy. The texture of swordfish really does change so much when it's overcooked. The grilled summer squash and oregano sauce sound like the perfect light accompaniments.

<p>Earlier this year I talked about adding more fish and healthier, Mediterranean-style dinners to my diet, and I have been true to that resolution. Last night I made my <a href="https://www.justalittlebitofbacon.com/pan-seared-cod-caper-parsley-lemon-sauce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pan Seared Cod</a> with a caper and parsley sauce again, and my <a href="https://www.justalittlebitofbacon.com/crispy-seared-salmon-with-green-sauce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crispy Seared Salmon</a> has been in rotation as well. I will note that both of these recipes get my picky &#8216;eh about fish&#8217; teenager to clean her plate. Bonus! 🙂</p>
<p>And now I have a recipe for Sicilian swordfish (also popular with the aforementioned teenager) which is not only packed full of flavor, but is great for nights when you don&#8217;t want to turn on the cook top and heat up the kitchen since it&#8217;s all done on the grill. Double bonus!</p>
<h2>How to Make Grilled Sicilian Swordfish</h2>
<p>This recipe is pretty simple and makes for an easy 30 minute meal: mix up a sauce and grill up the fish/veggies. Pour sauce over fish. Done.</p>
<p>To go into a little more detail:</p>
<p>You can make the sauce either before you start the rest (maybe while the grill is heating up) or while the fish grills. Either works.</p>
<p>Chop up some fresh oregano. Whisk together the salt and lemon juice. Then pour in the olive oil and whisk that in followed by mixing in the oregano.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s your sauce! Easy enough, yes?</p>

<p>Note: I use a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Culina-Stainless-Square-Vegetable-Grilling/dp/B00YBF97Z4/?tag=jualibiofba-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">wire mesh grill basket</a> for the squash. No worries about losing slices and I can cover the grill while it&#8217;s in there.</p>
<p>For the grilling portion of the program, once your grill and your grill basket are super hot, slice up some squash and toss it with salt and olive oil. Then spread it out on the grill and get it all darkly browned and soft. Set that aside while you make the swordfish. (Just so you know, the squash is room temp by the time you&#8217;ll be serving dinner. I like it that way, but if you want it hot, just stick it back on the grill for a couple of minutes while you finish up the swordfish.)</p>
<p>Once the squash is done, put the swordfish on the hot grill and cook it for about 5 minutes per side, or until the temp reaches 130F.</p>
<p>Then prick the fish with a fork, pour the sauce over, and top with chopped tomatoes.</p>
<p>You can serve the swordfish with orzo for a quick starch or make some brown rice (I use a rice cooker so it&#8217;s all hands off and takes about a minute to start) along side.</p>

<h2>How do you tell if Grilled Swordfish is Done?</h2>
<p>Thermometer!</p>
<p>Really, it&#8217;s the best way with swordfish. Unlike other fish, swordfish does not flake when it&#8217;s cooked through which means you don&#8217;t have an easy visual. And that means you have two choices: Either cut into it and look at it to see if it&#8217;s opaque yet, or use a quick read thermometer. And the thermometer is both easier and more accurate.</p>
<p>I have a <a href="https://www.thermoworks.com/Thermapen-Mk4?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIq-KRzd6e2wIVlISRCh1_aQUjEAAYASAAEgIg5vD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thermopen</a> which I use all the time to check everything from breads to butterscotch sauce to steaks and certainly to swordfish. I like it because it is super accurate, well made, and waterproof. It also comes in a pile of pretty colors, if you&#8217;re into that. 😉</p>
<p>As for temperature, I like my swordfish cooked to 130F. That will have it cooked through but not dry.</p>

<li><strong>Inspiration</strong>: This recipe is based on Marcella Hazan's recipe for <a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/swordfish-sicilian-style" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swordfish Sicilian-Style.</a></li>
<li><strong>Summer Squash:</strong> Any mix of summer squash will work. I like a mixture of green and yellow varieties. And you don't have to cut them at an angle; however, it does give more surface area for the grilling.</li>
<li><strong>Grill Basket:</strong> I have a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Culina-Stainless-Square-Vegetable-Grilling/dp/B00YBF97Z4/?tag=jualibiofba-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">wire mesh grill basket</a>. It will get discolored from the grill, but we wash it up and store it in the pantry between uses and it's worked well. I like it because you can get it very hot and also close the cover (no long handle).</li>

This is my kind of summer seafood dinner. Swordfish is one of my favorites for the grill. It&#8217;s so meaty and satisfying. I also like it cooked to 130 so it&#8217;s opaque but still juicy. The texture of swordfish really does change so much when it&#8217;s overcooked. The grilled summer squash and oregano sauce sound like the perfect light accompaniments. This dish, with a glass of wine on the patio, and I&#8217;m in heaven.</p>

The sear on those swordfish steaks is gorgeous!  I love fish of all sorts but admittedly haven&#8217;t cooked swordfish at home!  That is going to change because I&#8217;m printing this and making it soon for my family (who all love fish as well, thank goodness!)</p>

I love the simplicity and ease of this recipe. Definitely remind me of  Mediterranean light, healthy and flavorful cuisine. Such a great recipe for summer al fresco! The fish looks perfectly cooked and who doesn&#8217;t love perfect grill marks!</p>

Well doesnt this sound delicious, and I just love how easy the whole thing is to put together! I just happen to have a whole bunch of summer squash ready for the eating, and a grill waiting to be fired up. I see some swordfish coming up for dinner tonight, I am excited 🙂</p>

I&#8217;ve never made swordfish and now I can&#8217;t wait to try your recipe. It looks absolutely delicious and so perfect for a light summer dinner. I love your idea for the squash and the oregano sauce sounds incredible.</p>

Thanks for the reminder to use my thermometer.  I love mine, especially for roasts and steaks.  I&#8217;ve never made swordfish before but I can see how you would need a thermometer.  The meat is probably dense from all that muscle they used to fight off fishermen:)  The sauce sounds so authentically Italian.  Simple foods with quality ingredients.  Saving this, it looks amazing!</p>

My entire family loves fish and I am all abut using the grill right now. This looks like the perfect flavorful summer meal. The basket idea for the squash is genius. I have just put putting it in foil, but I must get a basket to make things easier. Thank you for this simple recipe!</p>

What a great summer meal. Swordfish is perfect for the grill. It is such a nice, meaty fish&#8230;.so it does not fall apart when you cook it. I wish I lived closer to a great selection of seafood. I have to drive into Toronto to get anything really good. This would be a great dinner any night of the week. With all the summer veggies (especially squash) you could never get tired of a delicious meal like this.</p>

This is the type of dinner that my husband and I do 5 out of 7 days a week.  Swordfish is always a favorite with us too, because it&#8217;s so meaty and rich.  Your sauce looks like it would add great flavor and grilled squash  sounds like the perfect accompaniment.  I will head to our fishmonger next week to pick up a few swordfish fillets&#8230; This looks divine.</p>
