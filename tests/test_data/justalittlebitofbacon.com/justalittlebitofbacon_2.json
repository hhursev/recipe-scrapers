    "Preheat grill. Put a metal grill basket on the grill and get it good and hot.",
    "Toss the sliced summer squash with a pinch or two of kosher salt and a drizzle of olive oil. Spread them on in the grill basket and cover the grill. Lower the heat to medium-high. Grill until the squash is soft and browned, checking every couple of minutes to stir and turn the squash, about 10 minutes. Adjust the heat/coals as needed to let the squash cook without burning. Transfer the squash to a serving bowl.",
    "Bring the grill back up to high heat. Grill the swordfish with the cover open for 5 minutes per side, turning once, or until the swordfish reaches a temperature of 130F.",
    "While the swordfish is grilling, make the oregano sauce. In a bowl mix together the lemon juice and salt until the salt dissolves. Then whisk in the olive oil and add the oregano.",
    "When the swordfish is done, move it to a serving platter. Prick the swordfish all over with a fork, then pour the sauce over the fish. Top with the chopped tomatoes.",
    "Serve the swordfish with the grilled squash and some rice or orzo pasta."
