I thought this dish was going to be complex but it was surprisingly easy. My chicken also looked just like the picture which never happens. I highly recommend making this dish. It is now my go to dish to impress my family and guest."

I do have one question, I saw on the photos of the ingredients and there is a photo of salt and pepper but I didn't see that on the instructions and the ingredients list although I didn't add it but maybe next time would you recommend to add it to the cornstarch while breading chicken or not really needed? \r\nOther than that Thanks for your recipe perfect recipe for a Saturday night in"
