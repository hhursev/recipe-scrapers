  "instructions": "Pour cold brew into an ice-filled glass. Stir in vanilla syrup.\nTop drink with chocolate cream cold foam and enjoy.\nVanilla Syrup\nPut water and sugar in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Lower heat and let mixture simmer for about 10 minutes until sugar is completely dissolved and mixture has thickened a bit.\nPour syrup into a heat-proof jar or container. Scrape out some of the seeds from the sliced open vanilla pod with a sharp knife and add them and the vanilla bean into the syrup.\nPlace syrup in fridge and let steep for at least 6 hours**. Syrup will thicken more as it cools. If you want a more intense vanilla flavor, you can leave the bean in after 6 hours.\nFor a quicker vanilla syrup, you can use vanilla extract instead of a vanilla bean. Stir about a Tablespoon of the extract into the saucepan right when you remove it from the heat. Syrup will be ready to use as soon as it cools.\nChocolate Cream Cold Foam\nMix milk, cream, vanilla syrup, and chocolate malt powder in a bowl until well combined. Or place all ingredients in a mason jar and shake. Keep in fridge until ready to use.\nTo turn into foam, you can either use an electric frother, hand mixer, or blender. Alternatively, you can shake the mixture in a mason jar until it's frothy.",
