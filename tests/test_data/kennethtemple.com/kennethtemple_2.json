    "Preheat the oven to 350°F degrees. In a bowl, mix the flour, coco powder, baking soda, salt, and cayenne until combined.",
    "In another bowl with a hand, mixer beat oil and sugar on low until combined. The mixture will look like wet sand. Add the eggs, beat until combined; the mixture will look like yellow wet sand. Add the melted chocolate and vanilla, mix for 10 seconds—alternate adding the flour mix and buttermilk, finishing with the flour. Mix on low, and scraping the sides of the bowl in between each, mix until combined and thick.",
    "Evenly pour batter between 2 greased 9-inch cake pans and bake for 35 minutes, rotating the pans halfway at 17 minutes 30 seconds. Make sure to stagger cakes when baking for even baking. Cakes are finished once the edges of the cake slightly pull away from the pan. Cool cake for 20 minutes, flip cakes over to them release from the pan.",
    "Make coconut pecan frosting: While cake is baking; turn on the heat to medium-high in a medium pot add the brown sugar, sugar and water, cook for 5 minutes, until sugar melts and turns a light caramel color. Remove from the heat, add the evaporated milk sugar will steam and bubble up bring to a boil over medium heat, and stir until sauce smooths out.",
    "While sauce is coming to a boil in a small bowl beat egg yolks and vanilla together. Mix 2 tablespoons of the caramel in the egg mixture, then pour back into the pot. Cook for 2 minutes, constantly stirring until mixture thickens. Stir in the coconut and pecans. Frosting will thicken as it cools.",
    "While everything cools, in a large bowl cream butter with a hand mixer until smooth. Over a medium bowl sift, powdered sugar, cocoa powder and salt. Add 1 cup of powdered sugar mix to the butter, mixture will look clumpy. Add the vanilla to coffee. Then alternate between adding 1 cup of powder sugar and coffee mixture, finish with the coffee, mix until smooth before adding next addition. Buttercream is finished when light, fluffy, and you have stiff peaks.",
    "Assemble the cake: Add one cake to cake stand, evenly spread a thin layer of chocolate coffee butter cream over the top of cake. Then evenly spread half the coconut pecan frosting across the top of cake. Repeat with the next layer.",
    "With an offset spatula, evenly spread buttercream around the edge of the cake. Hold the spatula upright against the side of the cake and press gently as you turn the cake slowly. Place the remaining buttercream in a decorating bag with a 1M tip. Pipe star decorations along the edges of the top of the cake. Place the cake in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before cutting."
