  "instructions": "Add the flour, the salt, and the water to a mixing bowl of a stand-alone mixer fitted with a dough hook. Mix for a few minutes until you get a sticky dough that pulls away from the sides of the bowl.\nLet the dough rest for 10-15 minutes and generously sprinkle your working surface with flour.\nUse a dough scraper to transfer the dough from the bowl onto a floured working surface.\nPush the edges using a dough scraper to give it as much of a rectangular shape as possible — this may be difficult as the dough is very sticky and loose.\nGenerously sprinkle the top of the dough with flour, then wrap the dough, with the flour included in cling film. Rest the dough for 10 minutes.\nHeavily flour a large working surface and place the dough in the center. Roll out, using a dusted rolling pin, into a 16x16-inch (40.5x40.5 cm) square.\nGently brush off the excess flour from the surface of the dough using a soft brush.\nCover 2/3 of the dough with 1/3 of the butter — evenly arrange it in small dabs first, then spread it gently using an offset spatula, leaving a 1-inch (2.5 cm) outer border unbuttered.\nBefore you can fold the dough, you will need to unstick it from the working surface. To do that, help yourself with a dough scraper and lots of flour that you should drive under the dough as you push it with the scraper.\nFold one-third of the dough over the middle part of the dough, then fold the other outer third of the dough over the center of the dough as well.\nNow, unstick this folded strip of dough, sprinkle some more flour on the work surface, and turn the dough 90 degrees, so its longer part is facing you. Roll out into a 16x16-inch (40.5x40.5 cm) square.\nBrush the flour from its surface and repeat the buttering step.\nRoll out to an 18x21-inch (45.5x53.5 cm) rectangle, taking care that the shorter side is facing you.\nTrim the edges with a dough scraper to get a neater finish. Brush away the flour and spread the last third of butter over the entire surface of the dough.\nRoll into a cylinder, with the help of a dough scraper to unstick the dough, while brushing away the flour with a soft brush. Take care to roll it very tightly, especially in the beginning.\nTrim away the edges, then cut the roll in half, so each half makes for 12 1-1.5-inch (2.5-3.75 cm) pieces.\nWrap each roll separately in cling film, and refrigerate for at least a couple of hours, but preferably, overnight.\nMix 60 ml (1/4 cup) of milk and 50g (1.75 oz) of flour in a bowl, then set it aside. To a heavy-bottomed saucepan, add water, sugar, and a cinnamon stick.\nHeat over low heat until the temperature reaches 100°C (210°F) — keep a digital thermometer at hand to check the temperature, and do not stir, but allow the syrup to dissolve on its own.\nMeanwhile, in another pan, boil the milk, and pour it over the milk and flour mixture, while constantly stirring. If desired, you can mix in 1/2 a teaspoon of vanilla.\nOnce the syrup reaches 100°C (210°F) temperature, take out the cinnamon stick with a pair of thongs, then pour it into the milk and flour mixture, while constantly whisking.\nOnce the syrup is incorporated, whisk for another 10-15 minutes so the mixture can cool down enough to add the egg yolks — it should be still warm but not hot — then, whisk in the yolks.\nSieve the custard into a jug, so it's easier to measure out when pouring it into pastry shells. Cover the jug with cling film and set it aside for later.\nCut the log from the refrigerator into 12 equal pieces, about 1-1.5 inches (2.5-3.75 cm) each.\nPlace each piece in 12-hole, regular-sized cupcake pan that you've greased lightly. Leave it to sit for 10-15 minutes so the butter can melt a bit.\nMoisten your thumbs with cold water, then press on the center of the pastry to push it down and stretch it a bit.\nThen, once the bottom of the hole is covered, draw the dough up its sides, taking care that you do not overstretch it, or the custard might spill out.\nPour custard into each pastry shell, so it's 3/4 full.\nBake in a 280-290°C (540-550°F) oven for eight to nine minutes.\nEat warm, sprinkled with powdered sugar and cinnamon.",

  "description": "This traditional pastel de nata recipe gives detailed instructions on the preparation. Because puff pastry needs to stay in the refrigerator for a minimum of a few hours, but ideally overnight, it is best to make the pastry the day before. Also, the amounts listed for custard are enough for 12 tarts, so you can store the other log of puff pastry in the freezer and use within two weeks or double the amount of custard and bake 24 pastel de nata instead of 12.",
