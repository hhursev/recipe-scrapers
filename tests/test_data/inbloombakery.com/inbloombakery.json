    "1 1/4 cups (300 ml) whole milk, warmed to about 110 degrees",
    "2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast",
    "1 tsp granulated white sugar (to bloom the yeast)",
    "4 3/4 cups (593 g) all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled",

    "1/2 cup (112 g) unsalted butter, very softened",
    "1 cup (220 g) light brown sugar, packed",

  "instructions": "For the Dough\nTo start, bloom your yeast. Mix your active dry yeast, sugar, and warm milk together and let sit for 10 minutes until foamy on top.\nNext, in a large bowl of a stand mixer with a whisk attachment, mix flour, salt and sugar together.\nTo the dry ingredients add the whisked eggs, vanilla and softened butter and mix.\nAdd in the yeast mixture and mix until everything is blended. Switch to a dough hook and knead on medium speed for 7-10 minutes until the dough pulls away from the edges of the bowl, forms a ball and springs back when pressed.\nForm the dough into a ball. Place the dough in a large, greased bowl. Cover with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel and place in a warm place to rise, (outside or a cold oven with the light on works well for this), for 1- 1 ½ hours, or until the dough doubles in size.\nFor the Cinnamon Caramel Sauce\nWhile the dough rises, make the sticky caramel sauce for the bottoms of the rolls, by mixing the butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, honey, vanilla, heavy cream and salt together in a medium bowl.\nGrease a 9x13 inch casserole dish. Spread the mixture evenly over the bottom of the pan.\nFor the Cinnamon Filling\nWhile the dough rises, also make the filling by mixing the butter, brown sugar, cinnamon and salt together in a small bowl. (If the filling is too firm and not spreadable, add heavy cream a tsp at a time until it's easily spreadable.)\nAssembling and Baking the Cinnamon Rolls\nOnce the dough has had a chance to rise, remove from bowl, punch dough to release the air, and roll out on a lightly floured surface. Roll the dough into about an 18 x 12 inch rectangle. It should be about 1/4 inch thick.\nSprinkle the cinnamon sugar filling over the dough and spread it evenly with an offset spatula.\nRoll up the dough tightly into a long log shape starting from the end closest to you. Cut of a bit off the ends to make the log even. Cut 12 rolls about 1 1/2 inches wide using unflavored floss or a very sharp knife.\nPlace the rolls in the prepared casserole dish with the cinnamon caramel sauce mixture and pour room temperature heavy cream in between each roll. Cover them with plastic wrap and let them proof in a warm spot for about an hour, or until they have doubled in size.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees about 15 minutes before the rolls are done proofing.\nOnce the rolls have completed their second rise, bake them for 29-32 minutes until golden brown. (30 minutes is usually perfect!)(Cover with aluminum foil for the last 5 minutes if they're getting too brown.)\nFor the Cream Cheese Frosting\nWhile they bake, make the cream cheese frosting by adding the softened butter to a medium bowl and mixing it on high speed with an electric mixer until pale and fluffy.\nAdd in the cream cheese and mix until combined on medium speed.\nSift the powdered sugar into the mixture a little at a time and mix on low speed until all is combined.(You can add more powdered sugar if you want the frosting to be sweeter.)\nThen add in the vanilla and combine on medium speed until the frosting is smooth.\nLet the rolls cool for 10 minutes, then cover the warm rolls with the cream cheese icing. Then serve!",
