  "title": "Banana Cream Pie",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 3.4- ounce package instant vanilla pudding (do not use \"cook and serve\")",
    "1 cup cold water",
    "1 14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk",
    "2 8-serving graham cracker or cookie crusts",
    "bananas (4-5 small bananas, or 2-3 large ones)",
    "1 pint heavy whipping cream",
    "⅓ cup powdered sugar"
  ],
  "instructions_list": [
    "In a medium bowl, combine pudding mix, cold water, and sweetened condensed milk. Mix well and place in the refrigerator to chill for a few minutes.",
    "In another bowl, whip 1 cup of whipping cream with an electric mixer until soft peaks form.",
    "Slice the bananas (probably 4-5 small bananas or 2-3 large bananas) and layer them on the bottom of the crusts. Set aside. Be sure and save the plastic domes that come with the pie crusts--you'll need them later!",
    "Remove pudding from the fridge and gently dollop the whipped cream on top of the pudding. Gently fold the whipped cream into the pudding mixture until well-combined.",
    "Now divide the mixture between the two pies. Rinse the pudding bowl and beaters and set aside for later.",
    "Place the clear plastic shells back on the pies and allow to chill for several hours. This step is very important, as without it the crust will fall apart, and it will lack flavor.",
    "If possible, immediately before serving, combine the remaining heavy cream and ⅓ cup powdered sugar in the bowl you mixed the pudding in and beat with an electric mixer on high until soft peaks form. Spread over the pies. (If you can't do this immediately before serving, it's okay to do the whipped cream step after you put the pudding mixture in the shells.)"
