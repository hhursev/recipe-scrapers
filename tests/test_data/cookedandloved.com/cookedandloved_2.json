  "instructions_list": [
    "To make chocolate cupcakes",
    "Line muffin tin",
    "Set your oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a muffin tin with cupcake liners.",
    "Combine chocolate chips and butter",
    "In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the chocolate chips and butter. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring after each, until smooth. Alternatively, melt them together in a double boiler.",
    "Mix melted chocolate mixture with sugar, salt, and vanilla extract",
    "Add the sugar, salt, and vanilla extract to the melted chocolate mixture. Stir until well combined.",
    "Add in eggs",
    "Crack the eggs into the mixture one at a time, beating well after each addition. The batter will become thick and glossy.",
    "Sift cocoa powder and add to batter",
    "Sift the cocoa powder over the batter and fold it in gently until no streaks remain. The batter will be dense and rich.",
    "Spoon batter into liners",
    "Spoon the batter into the prepared liners, filling each about two-thirds full. Smooth the tops with the back of a spoon or a spatula.",
    "Bake cupcakes",
    "Place the muffin tin in the oven and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs (not wet batter).",
    "Cool cupcakes",
    "Allow the cupcakes to cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.",
    "To Make the Whipped Cream",
    "Refrigerate cream",
    "Place the mixing bowl and beaters or whisk in the refrigerator for about 15-20 minutes. This helps the cream whip up faster (optional but recommended).",
    "Beat the cream",
    "Pour the cold heavy cream into the chilled bowl. Using an electric mixer at medium speed, begin to beat the cream.",
    "Add powdered sugar and vanilla extract",
    "As the cream starts to thicken, add the powdered sugar and vanilla extract. Continue to beat until soft peaks form.",
    "Continue beating for firmer cream",
    "If you prefer a firmer whipped cream, continue beating until stiff peaks form.",
    "Spoon on top of cooled cupcakes or use piping bag",
    "Once the whipped cream is ready, spoon it on top of the cooled cupcakes or use a piping bag for a fancier look. Top with fresh berries."
