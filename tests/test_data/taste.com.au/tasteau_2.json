    "To make the filling, preheat oven to 200C/180C fan forced. Line 2 baking trays with baking paper. Arrange the pumpkin on 1 lined tray, drizzle with 1 tbsp oil and season. Bake for 30 minutes or until tender and golden.",
    "Meanwhile, heat the remaining oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Cook the onion, stirring, for 5 minutes or until soft and lightly golden. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add lentils and passata. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 2-3 minutes or until thickened slightly.",
    "Add the pumpkin to the lentil mixture and mix gently to combine. Transfer to a large bowl and set aside to cool slightly.",
    "Combine the ricotta and nutmeg in a bowl. Set aside.",
    "Cut a piece of baking paper about 50cm long and place on a work surface. Arrange half the zucchini strips, side-by-side, across the paper diagonally (You should end up with a square about 30 x 45cm). Arrange remaining strips side-by-side in the opposite direction, weaving to create a lattice pattern. Top with the lasagne sheets, slightly overlapping. Top with ricotta mixture and spread to cover, leaving a 2cm gap on 1 of the longer sides. Top with the lentil mixture and spinach. Starting with the longest side, use the baking paper to help roll up to form a log. Trim the ends. Place log on the baking paper on the remaining lined tray. Spray with olive oil spray. Bake for 30-35 minutes or until light golden. Set aside for 10 minutes before slicing and serving."

  "description": "Pumpkin and lentils make this a substantial meat-free main that is perfect for any occasion. So easy, there’s even no need to cook the lasagne sheets – they will simply absorb the moisture from the spinach and zucchini. Not only is this delicious, but the lattice-style zucchini strips turn the vegetarian lasagne roll into a savoury centrepiece. More meat-free lasagnes we’ll be making Cut costs by cutting down on meat! If you’re having a dinner dilemma, lasagne is a great option. Many of the meat-free lasagnes we love to make use pantry staples and crisper-cleanout veggies. For a one-pan lasagne this mushroom lasagne (which comes with a super easy bechamel sauce recipe) is our other go-to vegetarian lasagne recipe. For something a little lazier, but undeniably delicious, give this silverbeet, pumpkin and blue cheese frying pan lazy lasagne a try!",
