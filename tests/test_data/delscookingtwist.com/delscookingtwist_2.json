    "Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.",
    "In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer, rub the granulated sugar and the zest of one lemon with your fingertips for about 20 seconds, until fragrant.",
    "Add brown sugar and softened butter and mix on medium speed for 3 full minutes, using a hand mixer or the stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add the egg and vanilla, and mix until combined.",
    "In a smaller bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt.",
    "Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients in 2 or 3 additions, and switch to a rubber spatula to mix until just combined. Add the fresh blueberries and gently mix until evenly spread throughout the cookie dough, being careful not to smash the blueberries.",
    "Using a medium size cookie scoop, divide the dough into 14 equal balls. Place 6 cookie dough balls on each prepared cookie sheet, leaving 2-3 inches between each ball, and flatten them out slightly using the palm of your hand.",
    "Bake the cookies, one sheet at time, in the center rack of the oven for about 8 minutes, or until the edges are just set while the top still look pale and slightly puffy.",
    "Remove the cookies from the oven and bang your cookie sheet on the countertop a few times to flatten the cookies a little and give them some texture. Grate the zest of the remaining lemon over the baked cookies. Let the cookies cool for 10 minutes in the baking sheet, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.",
    "To make the glaze, whisk together the confectioners’ sugar and lemon juice until the desired texture, adjusting the quantity of dry/wet ingredients as needed. Drizzle the glaze over the cooled cookies, and enjoy!"
