  "ingredients": [
    "⅔ cup (60g) rolled oats (gluten-free if needed)",
    "½ teaspoon baking soda",
    "1 cup (240g) creamy or crunchy peanut butter",
    "⅔ cup (120g) dark brown sugar*",
    "2 large eggs",
    "¼ cup (4 Tbsp) solid coconut oil (NOT melted)",

    "⅔ cup (100g) chocolate chips",

  ],
  "instructions_list": [
    "Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper, and set aside.",
    "In a small bowl, whisk together oats and baking soda. Set aside.",
    "In a large bowl, beat peanut butter, brown sugar, eggs, solid coconut oil and vanilla with an electric mixer until smooth, about 3 minutes. Mix in the dry ingredients with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, then gently fold in the chocolate chips.",
    "Using an ice cream scoop, distribute the cookie dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them out from each other, and slightly flatten each cookie ball with the palm of your hand.",
    "Bake for about 9 to 11 minutes, or until the edges are almost set while the center is still soft. The cookies may look slightly underbaked but that’s ok because they will continue to bake a few more minutes onto the warm baking sheet outside of the oven. Sprinkle with sea salt, and allow to cool for a few minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack. Enjoy!"
