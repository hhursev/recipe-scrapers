    "Prepare the Dough",
    "Warm the milk in the microwave for about 1 minute then stir to disperse any hot spots (see notes). Aim for between 105°F and 110°F.",
    "In the large bowl of a stand mixer, with the dough hook attached, add the warm milk, yeast, egg, granulated sugar and melted butter. Use a handheld whisk to thoroughly combine the ingredients then leave uncovered for 5 minutes.",
    "Add the salt and flour to the mixing bowl and use a wooden spoon or danish whisk to mix the ingredients together until a shaggy dough has formed.",
    "Place the mixing bowl on the stand mixer and mix with the dough hook on the lowest speed for 3 minutes. After this time the dough should look smooth and elastic. If you touch it with a clean dry finger the dough should feel tacky but should not stick to your finger. If any dough sticks add more flour a tablespoon at a time until it doesn’t stick. (This dough can also be made by hand - see notes.)",
    "Transfer the dough into a lightly oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm location for about an hour, or until the dough has doubled in size.",
    "For the Filling",
    "While the dough is rising, make the filling. Placed the softened butter, sugar and cinnamon into a small bowl and mix thoroughly until uniform in color. Set aside for now.",
    "Assembly",
    "Lightly grease and line a 9 inch springform pan with parchment paper just on the bottom. Set aside.",
    "Once the dough has doubled in size, punch it down in the bowl then lightly flour a surface and turn the dough out on to it.",
    "Roll the dough into a rectangle of about 20 inches by 12 inches.",
    "Spread the filling evenly across the entire surface of the rectangle.",
    "Use a sharp knife or pizza wheel to vertically cut the dough rectangle into 4 even strips. (Refer to images in post if needed.)",
    "Roll the first strip into a spiral then place the rolled spiral on top of the second strip and roll it again. Repeat for the remaining two strips until you have one giant cinnamon roll.",
    "Place the giant roll into the prepared springform pan (or similar), cover and leave somewhere warm for 30 minutes.",
    "Preheat the oven to 350°F.",
    "The cinnamon roll will have puffed up in its baking pan. The middle will keep popping out and that’s normal. Use the palm of your hand or spatula to gently press it back in then place the pan in the center of the preheated oven.",
    "Bake for 30 minutes, cover with foil and bake for another 15 minutes. The middle will have probably popped out again in which case, use a wooden spoon to press it down before adding the foil.",
    "Remove the cake from the oven when it is golden brown and feels dry and hard when touched on the edges. Leave to cool in the pan for 10 minutes.",
    "Prepare the Glaze",
    "In a medium sized mixing bowl, add all the cream cheese glaze ingredients and mix thoroughly until smooth and combined. The cream cheese glaze will be a thinner and runnier consistency than that of typical cream cheese frosting. If you want to thin it out you can add a little extra milk. If you want to thicken, add more powdered sugar.",
    "After the cake has cooled for 10 minutes, pour the cream cheese glaze all over the top.",
    "Slice, serve and enjoy while still warm!"
