This is an easy peasy 3-ingredient pumpkin bread recipe that is so cozy and perfectly captures those autumn flavors.</strong></p><p><em>Disclaimer: this post may contain affiliate links, which will take you to an external site.

This time of year as the leaves begin to turn and the air gets chilly, I am all about being cozy inside and baking with a hot cup of tea in hand. Creating delicious sweet treats for friends and family is soul-warming - feeding everyone is truly my love language. Sometimes however, I just want to get the baking over with so I can get to the eating part, and this recipe is the perfect solution.</p><h1>What is 3-Ingredient Pumpkin Bread?</h1><p>This delicious pumpkin bread is like the pumpkin pie spice brother of a typical banana bread. What makes this recipe so simple, is that you only need a box of spice cake mix, two eggs, and a can of pumpkin purée! The batter comes together within about five minutes and then all you need to do is wait for it to bake.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/60d29a175c2cd12b443f0a63/651e4c50bff21d27db6d88ec_Three%20Ingredient%20Pumpkin%20Loaf-21.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Easy Three Ingredient Pumpkin Spice Bread in a loaf pan"/></div><figcaption>Easy Three Ingredient Pumpkin Spice Bread</figcaption></figure><h1>Pumpkin Spice Bread Ingredients</h1><p>As the recipe title suggests, all you need is three ingredients! </p><ul role="list"><li>Box of spice cake mix - I used this one from <a href="https://amzn.to/46nD6ZC" target="_blank"><strong>Betty Crocker</strong></a></li><li>Large eggs</li><li>Canned pumpkin purée</li></ul><p>I also snuck in an extra optional ingredient or two as well...</p><ul role="list"><li>Confectioner&#x27;s sugar</li><li>Milk or water</li></ul><h2>Substitutions Variations and Tips</h2><p>Since there are so few ingredients, there are not as many options for substitutions in this recipe.</p><ul role="list"><li>Spice cake mix is the main ingredient, so it cannot be substituted.</li><li>Pumpkin purée could be substituted with pumpkin pie filling, but it won&#x27;t give you the best results since it contains extra ingredients and added sugar. For this reason, I really recommend you stick with using pure pumpkin puree.</li><li>Eggs can be replaced with a flax egg to make this vegan.</li></ul><p>Other ways you can spice this recipe up include:</p><ul role="list"><li>Adding a cream cheese frosting.</li><li>Using chocolate chips or butterscotch chips in the batter.</li><li>Pouring your quick bread batter into muffin tins to have as pumpkin muffins instead of a loaf.</li></ul><p>Some key tips for you while making this recipe are:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Eggs:</strong> You want to use room temperature eggs. This is important, because it will help the eggs mix evenly with the other ingredients to form a consistent batter. If you use cold eggs, there is a risk that the eggs will not mix evenly and will create a lumpy batter that either needs to be mixed too much and make your loaf thick, or it won&#x27;t bake evenly.</li><li><strong>Preparing your loaf pan:</strong> It is important to prepare your loaf pan before you start making your batter so that you can pour it in to the pan and place it in the oven right away. My favorite way to do this is to turn your loaf cake pan upside down and place it on the counter. Take your parchment paper and fold it like a present around the loaf pan. Flip the loaf pan right side up and simply pop the folded parchment inside. How easy is that?! If you prefer to skip the parchment paper, spraying the pan with non-stick cooking spray could also work.</li></ul><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/60d29a175c2cd12b443f0a63/651e4d43e761a2b4e16c4104_Three%20Ingredient%20Pumpkin%20Loaf-08.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Easy Three Ingredient Pumpkin Spice Bread in slices"/></div><figcaption>Easy Three Ingredient Pumpkin Spice Bread</figcaption></figure><h1>Equipment You Will Need</h1><p>This is such an easy recipe not just because of how few ingredients you will need, but also you don&#x27;t need a fancy hand mixer or other kitchen gadgets! All you need is:</p><ul role="list"><li>Large mixing bowl</li><li>Whisk</li><li>Rubber spatula</li><li>Loaf pan</li><li>Parchment paper</li></ul><h1>How to Make this Simple Pumpkin Bread</h1><p>While the full instructions are available on the detailed recipe card below, here are some tips on how to put this delicious cake mix pumpkin bread loaf together.</p><ul role="list"><li>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and pumpkin purée until they are well combined. </li><li>Slowly add the box of cake mix and stir until combined. Make sure not to mix too much because you don&#x27;t want to form gluten which will make your loaf tough.</li><li>Pour the batter into a prepared loaf pan and bake in a preheated oven for 45-60 minutes, until a wooden skewer comes out clean. Let cool in the loaf pan for approximately 10 minutes before cooling it on a cooling rack.</li></ul><h2>Optional Glaze</h2><p>Once your loaf has finished cooling, place it on parchment paper. In a small mixing bowl, whisk together your icing sugar and milk or water. Add the liquid to the powdered sugar slowly to make sure you don&#x27;t end up with a glaze that&#x27;s too runny. If that happens, simply add more icing sugar to thicken it up. Once you have the right consistency, drizzle it over the loaf.</p><p>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/60d29a175c2cd12b443f0a63/651e4cc113b882d4e3ff1a06_Three%20Ingredient%20Pumpkin%20Loaf-09.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Easy Three Ingredient Pumpkin Spice Bread with glaze"/></div><figcaption>Easy Three Ingredient Pumpkin Spice Bread</figcaption></figure><h1>Pumpkin Purée vs Pumpkin Pie Filling</h1><p>Pumpkin puree is essentially pumpkin that has been cooked and pureed to be ready to use in baking or even in savory dishes. It may have some salt added, but likely not much else. Pumpkin pie filling however, has various spices, added ingredients, and sugar in it. It is essentially ready to bake. So while it would be easy to use pumpkin puree in place of pumpkin pie filling and simply add your own sugar and seasonings, it would be difficult to do the reverse.</p><p>For this recipe, and for most of my baking in the Fall season, I prefer to use a can of pumpkin puree. This way, I can control what spices I am adding and how much sugar I use.</p><h1>How Long Does it Take to Bake 3-Ingredient Pumpkin Bread?</h1><p>That is the beauty of this recipe - it has such simple ingredients and is lightning fast to put together. You will spend about five minutes mixing your batter together and it will take around 45 to 60 minutes to bake. Make sure to check when your timer goes off that a wooden skewer inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean. That&#x27;s how you will know it is done!</p><h1>How to Serve</h1><p>This is one of my favorite ways to serve baking in the autumn season. It is great on its own! You can serve it with hot coffee or tea. I like to heat it in the microwave for a few seconds and it would also be delicious with some vanilla or maple ice cream or even whipped cream!</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/60d29a175c2cd12b443f0a63/651e4e2a86924df04f673e19_Three%20Ingredient%20Pumpkin%20Loaf-11.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Easy Three Ingredient Pumpkin Spice Bread"/></div><figcaption>Easy Three Ingredient Pumpkin Spice Bread</figcaption></figure><h1>Storage Tips</h1><p>Store in an airtight container or in plastic wrap or aluminum foil on your counter for up to one week. Storing in plastic wrap or foil will not last as long as if you keep it in an airtight container. You can also make your loaf last longer by storing it in the fridge.</p><h1>Frequently Asked Question&#x27;s</h1><p><strong>Is 3-ingredient pumpkin bread sweet?</strong></p><p>This recipe has all the wonderful flavors of fall. It is warm and cozy but not too sweet, with the pumpkin spice flavors we all know and love!</p><p><strong>Is 3-ingredient pumpkin bread gluten free?</strong></p><p>As long as you check that you have gluten-free cake mix, then yes it can easily be made gluten free!</p><p><strong>Is 3-ingredient pumpkin bread vegan?</strong></p><p>If you check your cake mix box to make sure it is vegan, then simply use a flax egg or other egg alternative to make this a delicious treat that is also vegan! </p><p><strong>What is the texture of pumpkin bread?</strong></p><p>The texture of this pumpkin bread is like a cake, with a little more density and moistness thanks to the pumpkin puree in it.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/60d29a175c2cd12b443f0a63/651e4ddbdae3534f64892fa8_Three%20Ingredient%20Pumpkin%20Loaf-17.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Easy Three Ingredient Pumpkin Spice Bread on cooling rack"/></div><figcaption>Easy Three Ingredient Pumpkin Spice Bread</figcaption></figure><h1>Other Pumpkin Recipes You Will Love</h1><p>Enjoyed this easy pumpkin bread recipe and looking for other ways to enjoy all things pumpkin?
