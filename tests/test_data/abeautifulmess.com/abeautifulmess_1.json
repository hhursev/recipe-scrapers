    "Use your Ninja Creami machine on “Ice Cream” setting.",
    "Remove the pint and take a look at your ice cream. If you think the texture is a bit chalky (or not as creamy as you want), make a hole in the center of the ice cream and add a tablespoon of water or milk. Then, use the “re-spin” function.",
