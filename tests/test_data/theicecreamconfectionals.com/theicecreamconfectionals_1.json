  "title": "Ninja Creami Black Forest Ice Cream",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 tbsp Cream Cheese",
    "1 tsp Vanilla Extract",
    "1/3 cup Granulated Sugar",
    "1 cup Whole Milk",
    "3/4 cup Heavy Cream",
    "1/2 cup Cherry Pie Filling",
    "1 tbsp Unsweetened Cocoa Powder",
    "1 tbsp Grenadine",
    "1 tbsp Captain Morgan Spiced Rum"
  ],
  "instructions_list": [
    "Place 1 tbsp cream cheese in a medium bowl and microwave for 5-10 seconds. If the cream cheese was in the fridge, these 5-10 seconds in the microwave will help soften it up to mix well with the other ingredients.",
    "Combine cream cheese with 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 tbsp grenadine, 1 tbsp Captain Morgan Spiced Rum (optional to spike) and 1/3 cup granulated sugar. Whisk until the ingredients are mixed together.",
    "Whisk in 1/2 cup cherry pie filling.",
    "Slowly whisk in 1 cup whole milk and 3/4 cup heavy cream.",
    "Pour the mixture into a Ninja Creami pint container, ensuring it does not go over the max fill line. There will probably be more ice cream mixture than needed, so dispose of the rest (or save it for next time) after filling the pint to the fill line.",
    "Freeze the pint for 24 hours, ensuring it is placed on a flat surface in the freezer.",
    "After 24 hours, remove the pint from the freezer, and plug in your Ninja Creami machine! Time for the magic. Remove the lid from the pint and grab the Ninja Creami outer bowl. Place the pint securely into the outer bowl and cover with the lid. Once the lid is on, place the outer bowl into the machine, twisting to the right until it locks into place. Press the \"Ice Cream\" button and (try to) wait patiently for the creamy treat coming your way.",
    "Once the process is finished, press and hold the button on the left side of the Creami to twist the bowl to the left and remove it from the machine. Twist the lid off of the outer bowl and remove the pint.",
    "Now your black forest ice cream is ready to enjoy!"
