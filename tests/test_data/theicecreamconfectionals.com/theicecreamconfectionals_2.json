    "Place 1 tbsp cream cheese in a medium bowl and microwave for 5-10 seconds. If the cream cheese was in the fridge, these 5-10 seconds in the microwave will help soften it up to mix well with the other ingredients.",
    "Combine cream cheese with 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1/3 cup granulated sugar, 1 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder, and 1/2 tsp salt. Whisk until the ingredients are mixed together.",
    "Slowly whisk in 1 cup whole milk and 3/4 cup heavy cream.",
    "Mix in 35 drops red food coloring to the mixture, ensuring the mixture is the desired color.",
    "Pour the mixture into a Ninja Creami pint container, ensuring it does not go over the max fill line.",
    "Freeze the pint for 24 hours, ensuring it is placed on a flat surface in the freezer.",
    "After 24 hours, remove the pint from the freezer, and plug in your Ninja Creami machine! Time for the magic. Remove the lid from the pint and grab the Ninja Creami outer bowl. Place the pint securely into the outer bowl and cover with the lid. Once the lid is on, place the outer bowl into the machine, twisting to the right until it locks into place. Press the \"Ice Cream\" button and (try to) wait patiently for the creamy treat coming your way.",
    "Remove the pint from the machine and the outer bowl. The next step is making the cream cheese mix-in!",
    "In a small bowl, combine 4 oz cream cheese and 1/4 cup granulated sugar.",
    "Microwave the cream cheese mixture for 45 seconds, or until soft.",
    "Take the already-spun pint of red velvet ice cream and carve a hole down the center. Scoop in the cream cheese mixture.",
    "Place the pint back into the machine and hit the \"Mix-In\" button. This will thoroughly mix the cream cheese flavor throughout! If you want more of a swirl that is visible, simply mix the cream cheese into the pint with your hand.",
    "Once the process is finished, press and hold the button on the left side of the Creami to twist the bowl to the left and remove it from the machine. Twist the lid off of the outer bowl and remove the pint.",
    "Now your red velvet ice cream is ready to enjoy!"
