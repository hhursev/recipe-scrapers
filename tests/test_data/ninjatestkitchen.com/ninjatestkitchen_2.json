  "instructions_list": [
    "Season turkey liberally with salt, using approx. 1 teaspoon salt per pound of turkey. Place turkey on a sheet tray fitted with wire rack and refrigerate for 24 hours.",
    "When ready to cook, remove turkey from fridge and allow to sit at room temperature for approx. 30 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, toss sweet potatoes with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Arrange potatoes in a single layer on a foil-lined sheet tray. Set aside",
    "Lift the grill lid and place turkey on the grill, skin-side up.",
    "Follow ignition instructions on unit, then select ROAST/BAKE function and use the TEMPERATURE CONTROL dial to set the temperature to 350°F. Press WOODFIRE FLAVOR to ignite pellets. (IGN and a progress bar will display on the control panel, indicating pellets are igniting). ",
    "Cook turkey until the thickest part of the breast reaches 145°F, about 2-3 hours.",
    "Meanwhile, make the glaze by adding the pomegranate molasses, honey, apple cider vinegar, olive oil, paprika, cayenne, and black pepper to a small saucepan, and place over medium heat. Whisk to combine and cook for approx. 5 minutes, or until warm.",
    "Once the turkey registers 145F on an instant-read thermometer, begin basing the turkey every 10-15 minutes with the pomegranate molasses glaze. Place sheet tray with potatoes on the back burner for the last 30 minutes of the cook cycle. Flip potatoes halfway during cook. Cook the turkey until an instant-read thermometer reads 160°F in the breast and 175°F in the thighs.",
    "When cooking is complete, remove the turkey from the grill and cover loosely with aluminum foil. Allow turkey to rest for 20-30 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, prepare the crumble topping for the potatoes by adding the pecans, brown sugar, melted butter, and cinnamon to a small bowl and mix to combine. Drizzle potatoes with maple syrup, and top with rumble topping. Return sheet tray to back burner and cook for an additional 10-15 minutes, while the turkey rests. ",
    "When cooking is complete, slice and serve the turkey with extra-virgin olive oil, flaky salt, and extra glaze as desired. Top potatoes with crème fraiche and serve immediately."
