Add 1 piece butter and cook, whisking constantly, until butter is melted, 20 to 30 seconds. Continue to cook, whisking in butter 1 piece at a time until all butter is incorporated and sauce has consistency of thin gravy, 3 to 4 minutes.\nWhisk in oyster sauce and orange zest and juice. Season with salt to taste. Reduce heat to lowest possible setting and cover to keep warm. Before using, whisk sauce vigorously to blend in any butterfat that has collected on surface.",

  "description": "Whisk butter into a little simmering water and—poof!—you've got beurre monté: liquid silk that pairs with any seasoning and gilds everything it touches. Beurre monté, emulsified melted butter, is a classic French preparation that can be drizzled over cooked meats, vegetables, pastas, and other dishes to add richness and a glossy appearance or used as a rich, creamy sauce base for pairing with a wide range of savory or sweet seasonings. Vigorously whisking cold butter into a measured amount of simmering water broke up the butterfat into tiny droplets that dispersed throughout the water, establishing a thick, creamy emulsion. Whisking oyster sauce plus orange zest and juice into the beurre monté produced a bold, rich, easy-to-make sauce that paired especially well with lean roasted or pan-seared proteins such as scallops, cod, pork tenderloin, or chicken breast; it was also great over pasta.",
