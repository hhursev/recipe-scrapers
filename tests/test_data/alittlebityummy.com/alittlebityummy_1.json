Cook for 2 minutes, stirring every now and then to stop the vegetables sticking to the bottom.\nMix through the flour and cook for a further minute. Then pour the stock into the saucepan. Mix well and bring to the boil. Allow to cook for 12 minutes, stirring every couple of minutes, until the potatoes are tender.\nReduce the heat to medium-low and add the milk, sweet corn and dried chives.
