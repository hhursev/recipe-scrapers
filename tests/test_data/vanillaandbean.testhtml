It has a soft tender crumb and earthy flavor, ideal for sammies and toast! This recipe is vegetarian and vegan friendly.A Note on HYDRATION - Flours vary in their moisture content from brand to brand. Additionally, local humidity conditions will impact how your dough feels from one batch to another. If the dough feels a bit too dry, try adding a teaspoon of water (more if needed). Too wet? Add more flour, a little at a time (only after the soaker is added). Even if you weigh your ingredients (which I highly recommend), this is not uncommon. As you gain experience in making sourdough, you&#039;ll gain a better understanding of how your dough should look and feel.Time above does not include the amount of time for fermentation, shaping and proofing which takes between 8-14 hours, depending on ambient temperature.\u00a0Use the time as a guide, not as a determining factor._______________________Example Bakers Schedule:  Friday-Saturday: feed starter. Saturday night: mix dough and ferment overnight. Sunday morning: shape dough, allow to rise (proof), bake.\u00a0________________________Serving size depends on how thick or thin the loaf is sliced. I can get about 12 thick slices or 15-16 thiner slices out of this loaf.","datePublished":"2020-06-12T20:49:54+00:00","image":["https://vanillaandbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/aaasourdough-20.jpg","https://vanillaandbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/aaasourdough-20-500x500.jpg","https://vanillaandbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/aaasourdough-20-500x375.jpg","https://vanillaandbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/aaasourdough-20-480x270.jpg"],"recipeYield":["1","1 loaf"],"cookTime":"PT50M","recipeIngredient":["1 C  (100g) Whole Rolled Oats (plus 2 Tbs for the top)","1/2 C  (105g) Water (room temperature)","3/4 C (150g) Sourdough Starter (100% hydration, previously feed and bubbly)","1 C (230g) Milk ((nut milk or whole dairy milk) I use 1/2 diluted unsweetened cashew milk - 80F (26C))","1/4 C (80g) Maple Syrup","1 Tbs (14g) Olive Oil ( + more for oiling the pan)","1/2 C + 1 Tbs (100g) Whole Wheat Bread Flour  ((see note**) or whole wheat flour)","2 C + 3 1/2 Tbs (300g) Bread Flour","1 1/2  tsp (10g) Fine Sea Salt"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToSection","name":"For the Soaker:","itemListElement":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Add the oats to a small bowl and pour the water over them.

<h2><strong><span style="font-size: 20pt;">Sourdough Love</span></strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">There are many sourdough variations and while I adore a crusty classic or multigrain sourdough, I can never pass up a softer loaf for toast, sandwiches and of course, French toast. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">So I set out to create a softer loaf with earthy flavors and in the shape of traditional sandwich bread. After tweaking the ingredients and testing to see if it holds up to the sandwich test, this loaf is my favorite of all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Maple oat sourdough is tender, soft, light and with the earthiest of notes. Lightly sweetened, featuring rolled oats and whole wheat flour, its rustic flavors shine. </span></p>

<h2><strong><span style="font-size: 20pt;">How to Make Maple Oat Sourdough Sandwich Bread</span></strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">If you&#8217;re in to making sourdough, you know it&#8217;s a process. Thing is, most of it is hands off time waiting for the dough to develop, waiting for it to rest, then waiting for it to come out of the oven. I tend to think about it longer than it takes the hands on time necessary to actually make it! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In summary, here&#8217;s how to make this sourdough: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>First</strong>, pour water over the soaker (in this case, rolled oats) then mix the dough. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Second</strong>, cover and rest the dough for 30 minutes. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Third</strong>, mix in the soaker. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Fourth</strong>, cover and rest the dough for 30 minutes. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Fifth</strong>, fold the dough. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Sixth</strong>, cover and rest the dough for 30 minutes, and then fold one last time OR continue resting right into bulk fermentation at room temperature for about 8-12 hours (at 70F). It will be doubled in size before moving on to the next step.  </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Continuing</strong>, pull the dough from the bowl and fold the dough, rest for 20 minutes, then shape and pan. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Next</strong>, proof the dough for between 1-2 hours or until the dough rises from 3/4&#8243;- 1&#8243; above the lip of the pan at center. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Last</strong>, spritz the dough with water, sprinkle with oats and bake for 45-55 minutes. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Allow the dough to cool for at least an hour before slicing into it as the crust and crumb development continues as the sourdough cools. A practice in patience. </span></p>

<h2><strong><span style="font-size: 20pt;">Fitting Sourdough into Your Schedule</span></strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">When it comes to sourdough, fitting it into your schedule can be achieved through a little strategic planning and, if needed, using a technique I keep in my back pocket for when something comes up and I need to extend the time between mixing and proofing&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">&#8230;because things come up, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><em>Retarding</em> the dough is optional, but is a tool for bread bakers. Retardation is simply the process of placing the dough in the refrigerator to slow down fermentation, so the rise takes longer.  This is handy for flavor development, but also, as a time management tool. </span></p>

<h2><strong><span style="font-size: 20pt;">When to <em>Retard</em> the Dough</span></strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">There are several times in which the dough can be retarded:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">during bulk fermentation &#8211; first rise</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">during proof &#8211; second rise</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>During Bulk:</strong> retard during bulk to slow down the rise allowing flexibility for when the dough will be shaped, proofed and baked. The dough still needs to double in size during bulk fermentation (first rise), so after refrigeration I pull it to room temperature, and let it finish rising, until it doubles in size. I&#8217;ve not tested the limits of this, but up to about 10 hours in the refrigerator generally fits my schedule.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> I like to do this when I mix in the morning. I just pop it in the fridge for the day, then pull it to room temperature before I go to bed. It’s doubled in size by morning!<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>During Proof:</strong> It&#8217;s possible, but I&#8217;ve not yet mastered retarding proofing dough (proof/second rise). I tend to overproof it because I&#8217;ve waited too long. This is a skill I continue to work on. Some bakers say a cold proofed dough is easier to score and produces better oven spring. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Either way longer fermentation produces more complex flavors in the bread. After all, time = flavor in the sourdough world. And I notice this too. Sometimes it&#8217;s subtle, but sometimes the sour flavor is more apparent. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 20pt;"><strong>When is the First Rise (bulk) Done?</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Knowing when bulk is complete takes a little practice and a watchful eye. Bulk fermented dough is ready for shaping when:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">it no longer looks or feels dense</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">is jiggly when the bowl is shaken</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">has about doubled in size</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">you may see a few large bubbles on the surface of the dough</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-size: 20pt;"><strong>When is the Second Rise (proof) Done?</strong></span></h2>

<h2><strong><span style="font-size: 20pt;">A Few Recipe Notes</span></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Looking for a starter? Check out how to make a <a href="https://vanillaandbean.com/sourdough-starter/">sourdough starter!</a> </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This maple oat sourdough sandwich bread calls for whole wheat <em>bread</em> flour which can be challenging to find. If unavailable, use regular whole wheat flour. The difference is subtle but whole wheat bread flour yields a little bit stretchier dough, and is easier to work with. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Shaping a sandwich loaf seems more challenging than shaping a boule, but this dough is pretty forgiving. With practice, it&#8217;ll become easier. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The whole rolled oats are a nice surprise in this dough. They soften as the dough ferments, so they&#8217;re barely noticeable yet they add a lovely, earthy flavor and whole grain nourishment. </span></li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Freezer friendly?</strong> Yes please! Store baked bread in a freezer bag either whole or sliced for up to two weeks. Thaw at room temperature. If using for toast, toast directly from freezer to oven. </span></li>
</ul>

It has a soft tender crumb and earthy flavor, ideal for sammies and toast! This recipe is vegetarian and vegan friendly.</span><div class="wprm-spacer"></div><span style="display: block;">A Note on <strong>HYDRATION - </strong>Flours vary in their moisture content from brand to brand. Additionally, local humidity conditions will impact how your dough feels from one batch to another. If the dough feels a bit too dry, try adding a teaspoon of water (more if needed). Too wet? Add more flour, a little at a time (only after the soaker is added). Even if you <strong>weigh your ingredients</strong> (which I highly recommend), this is not uncommon. As you gain experience in making sourdough, you&#039;ll gain a better understanding of how your dough should look and feel.</span><div class="wprm-spacer"></div><span style="display: block;">Time above does not include the amount of time for fermentation, shaping and proofing which takes between 8-14 hours, depending on ambient temperature. <strong>Use the time as a guide, not as a determining factor.</strong></span><div class="wprm-spacer"></div><span style="display: block;">_______________________</span><div class="wprm-spacer"></div><span style="display: block;"><strong>Example Bakers Schedule: </strong> </span><div class="wprm-spacer"></div><span style="display: block;">Friday-Saturday: feed starter. </span><div class="wprm-spacer"></div><span style="display: block;">Saturday night: mix dough and ferment overnight. </span><div class="wprm-spacer"></div><span style="display: block;">Sunday morning: shape dough, allow to rise (proof), bake. </span><div class="wprm-spacer"></div><span style="display: block;">________________________</span><div class="wprm-spacer"></div><span style="display: block;">Serving size depends on how thick or thin the loaf is sliced.

Add the flours and salt. First, mix with a fork, the dough will be shaggy. Then mix by hand, mixing, folding and pushing the dough until the flour is fully incorporated and no dry bits are present. It will seem dry at first, but the more you work the dough, the more hydrated it will become.  The dough will feel stiff and it will stick to your fingers as you go.  Do this for about 3-4 minutes. Use the fork to scrape off the dough on your fingers as much as you can. </span><div class="wprm-spacer"></div><span style="display: block;">Cover bowl with a damp tea towel.

To do this, dump the soaker on top of the dough and begin kneading and folding the dough over and on top of itself, incorporating the ingredients of the soaker. Do this for about 2-3 minutes or until the soaker is evenly distributed in the dough. It will seem like a lot of added bits, but as you work the dough and as the dough develops through fermentation, the soaker will incorporate. The dough will be stiff, wet and sticky. </span><div class="wprm-spacer"></div><span style="display: block;">Cover bowl with a damp tea towel, set a timer for 30 minutes and allow the dough to rest for 30 minutes. </span></div></li><li id="wprm-recipe-39562-step-1-2" class="wprm-recipe-instruction" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><div class="wprm-recipe-instruction-text" style="margin-bottom: 5px"><span style="display: block;"><strong>Fold the Dough</strong>: After the dough has rested, fold the dough. To do this, grab a portion of the dough while it remains in the bowl, stretch it up and fold it over, pressing your fingertips into the center of the dough. You&#039;ll notice the dough is a little less stiff and more workable at this point. Repeat, until you&#039;ve worked your way around the dough. </span><div class="wprm-spacer"></div><span style="display: block;">This is the first fold, and you can stop here and begin bulk fermentation, but If time permits, and optimally, you&#039;ll want to repeat this fold two more times as it improves the final dough&#039;s structure and crumb.

This will take about 8-10 hours at 70F (21C), but in a cooler kitchen the dough can take up to 12-14 hours to rise - this is the norm in my chilly kitchen 66F (18C). Use the time as a guide and not a determining factor. </span><div class="wprm-spacer"></div><span style="display: block;"><strong>The dough is ready when</strong> it no longer looks dense, is jiggly when the bowl is shaken, and has about doubled in size.</span></div></li><li id="wprm-recipe-39562-step-1-4" class="wprm-recipe-instruction" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><div class="wprm-recipe-instruction-text" style="margin-bottom: 5px"><span style="display: block;"><strong>Shape the Dough</strong>: In the morning, and with damp fingertips, coax the dough into a floured work-surface.  </span><div class="wprm-spacer"></div><span style="display: block;">With moist fingers, take a portion of the dough, gently stretch it towards you and fold it over towards the center, pressing it down gently. Repeat this process until you work the dough all the way around the dough. Using a bench scraper flip the dough over, cover with a tea towel rest the dough for 15-20 minutes. </span><div class="wprm-spacer"></div><span style="display: block;">While the dough rests, throughly coat the inside of a 9x5&quot; (23cm X 12cm) loaf pan with olive or coconut oil. Set aside.</span><div class="wprm-spacer"></div><span style="display: block;">Flour the work surface and using a bench scraper flip the dough back over. Use the photos in the blog post to help guide shaping. Gently shape the dough into a rough rectangle (sort of a football/oblong shape if you can) by dimpling the dough (think focaccia), to roughly 6&quot; wide and 8-10&quot; long. Fold the dough lengthwise 2/3 over onto itself and crease it firmly using the pinky side of your hand. Fold the 1/3 piece left towards the crease and pinch the seam closed. Fold in the ends, coming in about an 3/4&quot; - 1&quot; and pinch the seam closed. Flip the bread over and rock it back and fourth a bit and gently fluff the ends in. Cover with a tea towel and allow the dough to rest for about 5-10 minutes. </span><div class="wprm-spacer"></div><span style="display: block;">Scrape your work surface area of any excess flour and very lightly spritz it with water. Place the dough on the spritz of water (seam side down) and using lightly floured hands, cup the back of the dough and gently pull the it towards you until the surface is taught. Gently &quot;fluff&quot; the ends in again if needed to fit into the loaf pan.</span><div class="wprm-spacer"></div><span style="display: block;">Once the surface is taut and with one swift move, use the bench scraper to scoop the dough up and, place the dough into the prepared loaf pan. </span><div class="wprm-spacer"></div><span style="display: block;">If there&#039;s any misshapen edges that need tucking in, use a moist rubber spatula to gently finesse and shape the edges of the dough down into the pan.</span></div></li><li id="wprm-recipe-39562-step-1-5" class="wprm-recipe-instruction" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><div class="wprm-recipe-instruction-text" style="margin-bottom: 5px"><span style="display: block;"><strong>Proof the Dough (second rise)</strong>: Cover the pan with a damp tea towel and allow the dough to rise until the dough rises to about 3/4&quot; - 1&quot; (2cm - 2.54cm) above the lip of the pan at the center of the dough. The amount of time will vary depending on ambient temperature. At 70F (21C) proofing takes about an hour. In my chilly kitchen, about two hours.</span><div class="wprm-spacer"></div><span style="display: block;">Set an oven rack in the center of the oven.

Bake for 45-55 minutes, rotating and tenting the loaf at about 25-30 minutes so it doesn&#039;t get too dark. </span><div class="wprm-spacer"></div><span style="display: block;">The bread is ready when the internal temperature of the loaf is between 190F - 205F (87C - 96C).
