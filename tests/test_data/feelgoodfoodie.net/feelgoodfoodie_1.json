  "title": "Hummus",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas",
    "3 tablespoons lemon juice",
    "2 tablespoons tahini",
    "2 small garlic cloves",
    "¾ teaspoon salt",
    "3 ice cubes",
    "Extra-virgin olive oil (for serving)",
    "Paprika (for serving)",
    "Chopped fresh parsley (for serving)"
  ],
  "instructions_list": [
    "Place the chickpeas in a large bowl of warm water. Rub them with your fingers to release the skins, which will easily float to the surface of the water. Skim the skins from the water with a slotted spoon and discard. This is an optional step, but peeling the chickpeas is what yields a super creamy texture.",
    "Drain and dry the chickpeas as thoroughly as possible. Transfer the chickpeas to a food processor and pulse into a fine, breadcrumb-like texture, scraping down the sides as needed, about 15 seconds total.",
    "Add the lemon juice, tahini, garlic, salt, and ice cubes. Blend until completely smooth, about 5 minutes. Taste the hummus and adjust the flavor as needed by adding more lemon juice or salt.",
    "Spread the hummus onto a plate or into a bowl, sweeping the hummus with the back of a spoon to create swirls for catching the olive oil. Drizzle the hummus with olive oil and then sprinkle it with paprika and fresh parsley. Serve cool or at room temperature."
