  "title": "Stuffed Dates",
  "ingredients": [
    "18 pitted Medjool dates",
    "18 thin slices of prosciutto",
    "5 sheets defrosted phyllo dough",
    "125 g brie cheese, cut into 18 small pieces",
    "1/2-3/4 cup melted butter",
    "honey for garnish"
  ],
  "instructions_list": [
    "Preheat the oven to 375F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.",
    "Use a knife to cut the date lengthwise and remove the pit. Repeat for all dates (try not to cut through the whole date).",
    "Stuff each pitted date with a piece of brie and add a pinch of chili flakes to each date. Close the date, making sure the brie is tucked into the date and you canâ€™t see the cheese.",
    "Place 1 sheet of phyllo dough onto a clean surface and gently brush the entire sheet with a little melted butter.",
    "Using a small sharp knife or pizza cutter, on the long end of the phyllo dough, divide the dough into 4 long equal strips.",
    "On each strip lay a piece of prosciutto. Then, at the end of each strip add one brie-stuffed date.",
    "Roll the phyllo up over the filling, folding the sides in to seal. Continue to roll to use the entire strip of phyllo dough and roll it up like a small cylinder. Set onto a baking tray seam-side down.",
    "Repeat to make 18 stuffed date phyllo rolls, placing on the baking sheet spaced apart evenly.",
    "Generously brush the tops of each roll with the melted butter.",
    "Bake for 18-24 minutes or until golden brown and crisp.",
    "Serve drizzled with honey."
