      "reviewBody": "I have not made this yet…sounds very good and I will make it, but what’s the story with what pan to use?  You recommend a non-stick skillet and then in instructions you say to use a cast iron skillet?  So which one?  Think I’ll use the non-stick as I think the fish will stick to the cast iron, although I love cast iron or steel pans…"

      "reviewBody": "HEB in Texas sells fresh, never frozen salmon as well as other fish like halibut, sole, red snapper...they'll label the fish as previously frozen if it has been frozen, and fresh, never frozen if it has never   been frozen. They get fresh salmon all year long. If it's wild-caught they will say so, if it's farmed they also let you know. Wild-caught is seasonal of course. The one we get most often is organic Norwegian salmon, really delicious. Or the Ora King salmon from New Zealand but you have to go Central Market for that. In California we also got fresh salmon; wild-caught was a little more common and a lot cheaper. Where you live may determine whether you can find fresh fish but it would be a surprise if most major markets didn't carry fresh, never frozen fish. Whole Foods carries fresh salmon, pretty sure."

Serve with roasted fingerling potatoes to soak uptake sauce (a nice loaf of crusty bread would work, too). Easy enough for weeknights, but nice enough for guests."
