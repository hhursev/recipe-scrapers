  "title": "Buttery, Flaky Pie Crust Recipe",
  "ingredients": [
    "8 ounces low-protein all-purpose flour, such as Gold Medal Blue Label (1 2/3 cups; 225g), plus more for dusting",
    "1/2 ounce sugar (1 tablespoon; 15g)",
    "1 teaspoon (4g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume or use the same weight",
    "8 ounces unsalted, American-style butter, straight from the fridge (2 sticks; 225g), cold",
    "4 ounces cold tap water (1/2 cup; 115g)"
  ],
  "instructions_list": [
    "For the Dough: Whisk flour, sugar, and salt together in a medium bowl. Cut butter into cubes no smaller than 1/2 inch, and toss with flour mixture to break up the pieces. With your fingertips, smash each cube flat—that's it! No rubbing or cutting. Stir in water, then knead dough against sides of the bowl until it comes together in a shaggy ball. Dough temperature should register between 65 and 70°F (18 and 21°C); if not, refrigerate briefly before rolling and folding (see note).",
    "Make the Layers: On a generously floured work surface, roll dough into a roughly 10- by 15-inch rectangle. Fold the 10-inch sides to the center, then close the newly formed packet like a book. Fold in half once more, bringing the short sides together to create a thick block. Divide in half with a sharp knife or bench scraper. Dough temperature should still be somewhere between 65 and 70°F (18 and 21°C); if not, refrigerate briefly before proceeding (see note).",
    "For Single-Crusted Pies: Using as much flour as needed, roll one piece into a 14-inch circle; this size allows ample room to line pie plate, with enough overhang to form a generous border. At smaller sizes, dough will fall short, making it difficult to shape edges, and thicker dough will not crisp as intended. Transfer to 9-inch pie plate; dough should be easy to handle, and will not require any special procedures to move. Dust off excess flour with a pastry brush, using it to nestle dough into corners of pan. With scissors or kitchen shears, trim edge so that it overhangs by 1 1/4 inches. Fold overhang over itself to create thick border that sits on top edge of pie plate, not below. Crimp or shape crust as desired. Repeat with remaining dough. Wrap with plastic and refrigerate at least 2 hours and up to overnight. Use as directed in your favorite recipe.",
    "For a Double-Crusted Pie: Using as much flour as needed, roll one piece into a 14-inch circle; this size allows ample room to line pie plate, with enough overhang to form a generous border. At smaller sizes, dough will fall short, making it difficult to shape edges, and thicker dough will not crisp as intended. Transfer to 9-inch pie plate; dough should be easy to handle, and will not require any special procedures to move. Dust off excess flour with a pastry brush, using it to nestle dough into corners of pan. With scissors or kitchen shears, trim edge so that it overhangs by 1 1/4 inches. For solid top crust, roll remaining dough as before; for lattice-top pie, roll into a 9- by 15-inch rectangle instead. Transfer to a baking sheet or parchment-lined cutting board. (The parchment will prevent dough from absorbing any savory odors from the board.) Wrap both portions in plastic and refrigerate at least 2 hours and up to overnight. Use as directed in your favorite recipe; after filling pie and sealing crusts together, refrigerate 30 minutes before baking.",
    "For a Blind-Baked Pie : Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350°F (180°C). Line pie shell that has been chilled for at least 2 hours (as outlined in Step 3) with large sheet of aluminum foil, pressing so it conforms to curves of plate. (A second sheet of foil may be needed for full coverage.) Fill to brim with sugar, transfer to a half sheet pan, and bake until fully set and golden around the edges, 60 to 75 minutes. Fold long sides of foil toward middle, gather short sides, and use both hands to carefully transfer sugar to heat-safe bowl. Let sugar cool to room temperature. If needed, continue baking crust a few minutes more to brown along the bottom."

      "reviewBody": "Just tried the pie again this morning, and I've revised my opinion. This recipe deserves a nobel prize. I'll never use another. The crust is perfect. For all those with problems, all I can say is you're doing something wrong. Check your steps carefully. Are you using the right ingredients? Do you have a good oven thermometer? Are you watching oven temperature carefully? Are you using the right kind of pie pan? If you deviate from Stella's instructions by one iota than you have no right to complain. My crust did not melt in the oven. It was not greasy. It was not semi-translucent(!). It was not hard to cut with a knife. No. It was crisp, flakey, beautifully browned, and delicious. Follow the instructions. Don't be a hockey puck ."

      "reviewBody": "I made this crust for the first time on Thanksgiving and had a butter flood! My crust shrank down and it was so tough, I had a hard time cutting it to serve. It sounds like others have had similar problems. But the recipe sounded so promising that I tried it again a few days later. (More pie- great!) First, I read all the comments, and then found a related article and read all those comments too. (https://www.seriouseats.com/2016/06/how-to-make-a-beautifully-flaky-pie-crust) That's where I figured out my problem.\n\nAs a last step, Stella says to \"Use as directed in your favorite recipe.\" My recipe said to start the pie at 425F for 20 min and then lower the temp. I also used a pizza stone since that normally gives me a great bottom crust. Apparently this is a double no for this recipe! One of Stella's comments says an oven temp over 400 or a pizza stone will make the butter leak. It would be nice if this were mentioned in the recipe. My second try worked so much better and the crust mostly held its shape, and was very flaky and delicious. I hope this helps someone else succeed with this yummy recipe!"

      "reviewBody": "I’ve had mixed success with this recipe, but after multiple trys and, often, moderate failure, I’ve come to agree with other success-story comments here. You’re probably missing something. For me, I wasn’t really kneading the dough (as instructed), but rather was trying to let the lamination bring the dough together as in other recipes. Often, I ended up with a brittle crust and moderate to significant butter pooling, even though I was using all the right ingredients and thought I was doing everything “to a T.” Now, I realize this light kneading 1) promotes gluten development (as discussed) helping the dough expand and hold on to the butter—think croissants or puff pastry, which undergo significant gluten development—and 2) mixes some of the butter further into the flour, helping with tenderness.\n\nKneading the dough into a shaggy mass and keeping everything else the same removed both of my issues and gave me the crust promised. So, as many have said before, (actually) following Stella’s direction will lead to success."

      "reviewBody": "Have used Gold Medal AP flour for years and have always baked by weight.\n\nGold Medal flour lists 1/4 C = 30g; therefore, for ~225g, cup volume is a scant 2 C flour or 1-3/4 C + 2 TBSP flour, not 1-2/3 C (160g).\n\nThis pie dough is along the lines of a 100% butter-to-flour blitz puff pastry.\n\nIf anyone is using volume measurement, the butter ratio becomes 140% -- not 100% -- which may also explain why dough for some turns out greasy with butter pooling."
