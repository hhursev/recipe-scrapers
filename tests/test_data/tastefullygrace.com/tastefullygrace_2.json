    "In the bowl of a mixer, beat together the egg whites to soft peaks, about 1-2 minutes on medium-high speed.",
    "Slowly add in ¼ cup granulated sugar and beat to stiff peaks, about 1-2 minutes on medium-high speed. Gently scoop the egg white mixture into another bowl, and set aside.",
    "In the scooped out bowl (no need to rinse), beat the egg yolks with ½ cup granulated sugar on medium-high speed until pale and thick, about 1-2 minutes.",
