    "Cut butter into small cubes and place in a saucepan over medium heat.",
    "Let the butter melt and then begin cooking. Stir frequently and watch the butter.",
    "Continue cooking and stirring until the butter starts to smell nutty and turns a medium amber color. Remove from the heat and transfer into the bowl (make sure to get all the brown bits) of your stand mixer and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes in the fridge before proceeding with the gluten free snickerdoodle recipe. The browned butter needs to be solid. It should have the same consistency as room-temperature butter.",
    "In a small mixing bowl combine the gluten-free flour, cornstarch, baking soda, cream of tartar, and kosher salt. Whisk to combine and set aside.",
    "In the bowl of a stand mixer combine the cooled but still soft browned butter, light brown sugar, and granulated sugar, and beat at medium speed for 4-5 minutes until fluffy and pale. Halfway through, pause to scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible rubber spatula.",
    "Once the butter-sugar mixture is light and fluffy, add the room-temperature egg and a teaspoon of vanilla extract. Mix until incorporated. Turn off the mixer and scrape down the sides.",
    "Add your dry ingredients and mix until combined. Transfer the dough to an airtight container or cover the mixing bowl and chill the gluten free brown butter snickerdoodles dough for 30-45 minutes.",
    "When ready to bake, preheat your oven to 350F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.",
    "In a small bowl combine the granulated sugar and ground cinnamon and mix. Scoop medium-sized balls of cookie dough (using a Medium Sized Cookie Scooper) and roll them into cookie dough balls. Roll them in the cinnamon sugar mixture, then place no more than 6-7 of them on the prepared cookie sheets.",
    "Bake them one tray at a time at 350F for 9-11 mins or until they look puffy and light golden brown. I recommend rather underbaking them slightly than overbaking and ending up with dry cookies.",
    "Remove the snickerdoodles from the oven and allow them to cool for 10 minutes on the sheet pan before transferring them to a wire rack. The cookies will deflate – that is completely normal.",
    "Repeat with the remaining dough portions."
