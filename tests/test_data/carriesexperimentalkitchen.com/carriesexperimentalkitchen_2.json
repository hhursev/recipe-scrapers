    "For the Chicken",
    "Using a meat mallet, flatten the tenderloins so that they are even in thickness.",

    "Coat each piece of chicken first in the flour, then the eggs, and then the breadcrumb mixture.",
    "Heat a large nonstick saute pan over medium heat and add the oil and butter. Once melted and hot, add the chicken to the pan and fry on both sides until cooked through; approximately 3-5 minutes per side depending on the thickness. You may need to do this in two batches.",
    "Remove chicken from the pan and drain on paper towels to absorb any excess oil. Set aside.",
    "For the Sauce",
