  "description": "Grilled cheese for breakfast? Why not? Think of this mashup as a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich meets \"eggs in a basket\" or toad in a hole. Canadian bacon brings a similar salty smokiness you expect from regular bacon but with fewer Points while gooey, melty cheese and eggs with perfectly runny yolks keep things classic.",
