  "ingredients": [
    "1/4 cup warm water",
    "1 tablespoon sugar",
    "1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast",
    "3/4 cup warm milk",
    "3/4 cup plain yogurt",
    "4 cups all-purpose flour",
    "1 teaspoon Kosher salt",
    "1 stick melted butter, for brushing",
    "4 cloves minced garlic",
    "Fresh cilantro, to top"
  ],
  "instructions_list": [
    "In a glass measuring cup, combine the yeast, sugar, and water and let sit until very foamy, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk the flour and salt together in a large bowl and create a well in the center.",
    "Whisk in the warm milk and plain yogurt into the yeast mixture until well-combined. Pour into the well in the dry ingredients. Stir until a dough is formed, then turn out onto a lightly-floured surface and knead until smooth, about 3-4 minutes. Transfer the dough to a large, lightly oiled bowl and cover loosely with a damp kitchen towel. Let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 hour.",
    "Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Knead briefly into a disc and cut the dough into 12 equal-sized pieces. Roll each piece into a ball.",
    "Heat a large, heavy bottomed skillet over medium heat. Roll each dough ball out until it is about 1/4 inch thick and approximately 6 inches wide. Brush the dough lightly with butter and place one at a time onto the hot skillet. Cook until large bubbles form on the surface, about 2 minutes. Flip the dough and cook the other side until golden, about 1-2 more minutes. Stack the cooked flat bread on a plate and cover with a towel to keep warm as you cook the remaining pieces.",
    "Add the minced garlic to the remaining melted butter. Loosely cover and microwave for 15 seconds. Brush the warm naan with the garlic butter (scooping out some of the garlic to sit on top) and sprinkle generously with cilantro. Serve warm."

      "reviewBody": "Tried this, my first attempt at naan, over the weekend. I was inspired by an Indian meal from the week prior. I **LOVE** naan, and this recipe was very good. A strong vote in its favor is, as you mention, it is highly error-resistent. I ran out of time after the rise so I punched down the dough, wrapped and refrigerated it overnight. I took it out the next day and let it rise again for about 90 minutes and it came out quite well.\r\n\r\nMy only issue was that, while it was a great combination of chewy and soft, it was not as moist as restaurants tend to serve it. Perhaps a bit more milk and/or yogurt next time.\r\n\r\nI also mixed several minced cloves into the dough as well as all of the cilantro. I think this worked rather well. I did this in addition to using the garlic butter. Last, I used a two-burner griddle to speed cooking time, and that worked well.\r\n\r\nThank you for the recipe!"

Just make sure the tray preheats well.\r\n\r\nI've done 2 types of naan - one exactly as described and the second Vegan for my GF. The vegan one with soy milk and soy yoghurt came out much more like real naan you get in an Indian restaurant. I'll be making the vegan one for myself as well next time:)"

I'll just use one next time until I master this. One of the pans was too hot and I will have to make sure not to use a pan that's too hot next time. Everyone loved it and fought over the garlic butter... guess I can't have a peaceful family meal without explaining the rules of politeness. I can't wait to make these again. I can see why people are talking about eating too much. I'm a little nervous that we'll all smell like garlic tomorrow since the minced garlic is merely warmed and not really cooked!

I weighed out my 4 cups of flour and this dough was waaaaay too sticky. Like we’re talking extremely high hydration like 80%+. I had to add at least another cup to a cup and 1/2 of flour. I even used Greek yogurt which has less liquid. I also live in the desert and typically I need to add more liquid to my doughs not the other way around.
