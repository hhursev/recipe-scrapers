    "2 tsp paprika",
    "1 tsp salt",
    "1 tsp pepper",

  "instructions_list": [
    "For the Slow Cooker",
    "Wash and cut all of your vegetables. Cut your onion into a small dice, the carrots into a large dice (about 1 inch pieces), and your mushrooms into a large dice as well.",
    "Into the vessel of your slow cooker add the beef broth, Worcestershire sauce, onions, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika. Stir to mix in the seasonings.",
    "For the beef I used top round (London Broil). This is a cheap, lean piece of meat. Top sirloin is a more tender piece of beef of similar leanness but it is more expensive. Feel free to use either.",
    "Lay the beef into the vessel and place it into the slow cooker. Cook on high for 4 hours or low for 6 hours.",
    "When there are 30 minutes left of cook time, add in the mushrooms and carrots and stir to cover with the liquid.",
    "For the Pasta",
    "After you add in the vegetables you can start on your pasta. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add the pasta of your choosing. I used fusilli.",
    "Strain and set aside when finished cooking.",
    "For the Sauce",
    "After the slow cooker timer is finished, remove the lid and pull out the beef. Set it aside to break down.",
    "Mix together 3 tbsp of tapioca starch (or cornstarch) with ¼ cup of cold water to make a slurry.",
    "Drizzle the slurry into the slow cooker and stir constantly to thicken the sauce.",
    "Next add in the cream cheese, Greek yogurt, and dijon mustard. Stir to melt the cheese and combine.",
    "Break the beef down into bite sized pieces or shred it up. Add it to the sauce and mix.",
    "Dump in your pasta and mix until all of the sauce is evenly distributed. Taste test and adjust with salt and pepper to meet your needs.",
    "Plating",
    "This recipe makes 5 servings. Divide the contents of the slow cooker evenly between your containers. Top with chopped parsley for garnish if you please."
