  "instructions_list": [
    "For the Rice",
    "Cook enough rice to yield 2 cups (300g) of cooked rice. 1 cup of dry rice will make between 2-3 cups of rice depending on what kind you use.",
    "For the Sauce",
    "Mix the lime juice, sriracha, honey, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper together. Whisk to combine.",
    "For the Chicken",
    "Preheat your oven to 400 °F (204 °C).",
    "Place the chicken thighs into a large bowl. Cut off any excess fat or skin from the thighs.",
    "Pour roughly ½ of the sauce over the top of the chicken and mix it with the chicken until it is completely coated. Allowing it to marinate for 30 minutes to a couple of hours is best but if you want to just cook it immediately, that will do.",
    "Line a sheet pan with foil and lay the chicken thighs smooth side down on the sheet pan, ensuring enough space between each thigh to promote proper browning.",
    "Cook the chicken for 20-25 minutes then remove from oven and flip. Return to the oven for an additional 5-10 minutes.",
    "Once finished, remove from the oven and allow it to rest before cutting.",
    "For the Vegetables",
    "While the chicken is cooking, wash and cut all of your vegetables.",
    "Cut the green onion whites and greens into thin slices, separating them for their use later.",
    "Cut the sweet potato into a medium to large dice, about ½ inch in size.",
    "Add the potatoes to a large bowl and drizzle in 1 tbsp of oil and salt and pepper to your liking. Toss to coat.",
    "Spread the potatoes out on an oiled sheet tray and place into the oven for 20-25 minutes, flipping around the 15 minute mark. I would recommend you place this tray above your chicken so the chicken isn't subjected to the steam from the potatoes.",
    "While the potatoes are cooking, thaw out the broccoli in the microwave. Don't cook it or heat it, just thaw it to take out the chill and drain away any water that is released.",
    "Place the thawed broccoli into a large bowl and add the scallion whites with 1 tbsp of oil and a bit of salt and pepper. Toss to coat.",
    "Heat a large skillet over medium high heat and add in the broccoli and scallions. Cook for 3-5 minutes to develop some color on the broccoli but be careful to not overcook it as it will lose its texture and become mushy.",
    "Construction",
    "After the chicken has rested for a bit, cut it into a medium to large dice to match the size of the potatoes.",
    "Add the chicken and potatoes to the skillet with the broccoli along with the remaining sauce. Stir to combine.",
    "Add in 2 cups of cooked rice and mix again. Taste test and adjust with salt and pepper as needed.",
    "Plating",
    "This recipe makes 5 servings. Divide the contents of the skillet 5 ways. Garnish with green onion tops and a lime wedge if you wish."
