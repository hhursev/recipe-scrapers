    "PIE CRUST",
    "I like to make my pie crust the night before or at least 2 hours before to give it time to rest.",
    "Once the dough has rested, unwrap and place on a lightly floured surface. Roll out to 1/4” (6mm) in thickness, turning the dough 45˚ often as you are rolling to keep it even. You want the circle to be slightly larger than your pie tin. Transfer to a 9” pie tin, and arrange to ensure that the dough is well settled.",
    "Trim the dough using scissors or a sharp knife, leaving about one inch excess around the edges. Gently tuck the dough under and onto itself, to give you a neat folded edge. Chill in the fridge for 15-20 minutes, then remove from the fridge and crimp as desired. Dock all over with the tines of a fork, then chill for a further 30 minutes, or freeze for 20 minutes or until solid.",
    "While the crust is in the fridge, preheat the oven to 425˚f / 220˚c. Cut a piece of parchment slightly larger than the pie dish. Line with the parchment paper and fill with pie weights or dried beans, filling right to the bottom of the crimps.",
    "Place the pie tin on a baking sheet, and place in the oven. Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until the edges are slightly golden brown. Remove from the oven, remove the parchment paper and beans. Return to the oven and bake for a further 2-3 minutes, until the inside of the crust is set and barely golden.",
    "Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely on a wire rack in the pan. If you are baking the rest of the pie straight away, reduce the oven temperature to 350°f / 180°c.",
    "PECAN PIE FILLING AND ASSEMBLY",
    "Preheat the oven to 350°f / 180°c. Spread the pecan halves out on a baking sheet. Toast for 10-12 minutes, shaking the pan often, or until golden throughout (snap one open to check). Leave to cool.",
    "Meanwhile, place the butter in a medium saucepan, and place over medium heat. Cook until the butter has melted, and then continue to cook, swirling the pan often, until the butter foams and turns golden brown and nutty - this should take 3-4 minutes. Transfer to a bowl, allow to cool slightly.",
    "To make the ganache, place the chopped chocolate into a small bowl. Heat the cream in a small saucepan until there is just movement around the edges, then pour over the chocolate, place a plate on to act as a lid, then leave to sit for 3-4 minutes. Whisk until completely smooth.",
    "Pour the chocolate ganache into the bottom of the par-baked pie crust, and smooth with an offset spatula. Place in the freezer while you prepare the rest of the filling.",
    "To make the remainder of the filling, whisk together 70g (see Notes section below) of the cooled brown butter, the dark brown sugar, and golden syrup together in a large bowl. Add the eggs one at a time, and whisk to combine. Add the heavy cream, vanilla bean paste, apple cider vinegar, and salt, and whisk to combine.",
    "Arrange the pecans in the cooled par-baked pie crust. Place onto a baking sheet.",
    "Pour the prepared filling over the pecans - hold back a little filling if you are worried that it will be too full. Flip over any pecans using your fingers so the rounded side is up.",
    "Place the pie into the oven and bake for 50 to 55 minutes, until the top is golden brown, the edges feel set, and the middle still jiggles a little. It should be a little puffy.",
    "Remove from the oven and allow to cool at room temperature for at least 3-5 hours before slicing.",
    "Store leftovers at room temperature loosely covered by foil."
