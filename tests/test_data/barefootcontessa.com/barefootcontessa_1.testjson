  "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Arrange the eggplant and zucchini in single layers on 3 sheet pans lined with parchment paper. Brush them generously with the olive oil on both sides, using all of the oil. Sprinkle with the oregano (I crush it in my hands), 1 tablespoon salt, and 1\u00bd teaspoons pepper. Roast for 25 minutes, sprinkle the garlic evenly on the vegetables, and roast for another 5 minutes, until the vegetables are cooked through. Remove from the oven and lower the temperature to 350 degrees.\nMeanwhile, fill a very large bowl with the hottest tap water and add enough boiling water to bring the temperature to 140 degrees. One at a time, place the noodles in the water and soak them for 15 -minutes, swirling occasionally so they don\u2019t stick together. Drain and slide the noodles around again.\nCombine the ricotta, goat cheese, eggs, basil, \u00bd cup of the Parmesan, 1\u00bd teaspoons salt, and \u00be teaspoon pepper in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mix on low speed.\nSpread 1 cup of the marinara in a 9 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 2-inch baking dish. Arrange a third of the vegetables on top, then a layer of the noodles (cut to fit), a third of the mozzarella, and a third of the ricotta mixture in large dollops between the mozzarella. Repeat twice, starting with the marinara. Spread the last 1\u00bd cups of marinara on top and sprinkle with the remaining \u00bd cup of Parmesan. Place the dish on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper and bake for 60 to 70 minutes, until the lasagna is browned and bubbly. Allow to rest for 10 minutes and serve hot.",
