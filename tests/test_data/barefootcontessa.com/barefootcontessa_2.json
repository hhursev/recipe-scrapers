On a second dinner plate, combine the bread crumbs and the ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese. Coat the chicken breasts on both sides with the flour mixture, dusting off the excess, then dip both sides into the egg mixture and finally dredge both sides in the breadcrumb mixture, pressing lightly.\nHeat 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large (12-inch) sauté pan over medium-low heat and cook 2 chicken breasts at a time for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, until just cooked through. Remove the cooked chicken to a plate (or keep warm in the oven; see below). Add more butter and oil and cook the rest of the chicken breasts.\nToss the salad greens with the lemon vinaigrette. Place each chicken breast on a plate and pile mound of salad on top. Serve hot with shaved or grated Parmesan on top.\nNotes: You can pound the meat between two sheets of wax paper, plastic wrap, or directly on a board.\nTo keep the cooked chicken breasts warm, place on a sheet pan in a 200-degree oven for up to 15 minutes.\nMeasure the lemon juice in a 1-cup glass measuring cup. Add the olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper and whisk together.",
