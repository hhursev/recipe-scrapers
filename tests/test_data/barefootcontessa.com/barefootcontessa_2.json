    "Pound the chicken breasts until they are ¼-inch thick. You can use either a meat mallet or a rolling pin.",

On a second dinner plate, combine the bread crumbs and the ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese. Coat the chicken breasts on both sides with the flour mixture, dusting off the excess, then dip both sides into the egg mixture and finally dredge both sides in the breadcrumb mixture, pressing lightly.",
