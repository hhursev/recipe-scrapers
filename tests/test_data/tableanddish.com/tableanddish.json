  "ingredients": [
    "1/2 cup all-purpose flour for dredging",
    "1 teaspoon sea salt",
    "1 teaspoon fresh black pepper",
    "3 fresh swordfish steaks",
    "1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil",
    "2 tablespoon unsalted butter",
    "4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced",
    "1/3 cup fresh lemon juice",
    "1/2 cup dry white wine",
    "2 tablespoons capers, drained",
    "1/3 cup minced fresh parsley",

  "instructions_list": [
    "Combine the flour, pepper, and salt in a shallow dish such as a pie plate. Dredge the swordfish steaks in the flour mixture and shake off any excess.",
    "In a large skillet, over medium-high heat, heat the olive oil with the butter. When hot, add the fish and cook until browned on the underside, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn fish over and cook until well browned on the other side. Transfer to a platter and keep warm.",
    "To make the sauce:",
    "Add the garlic to the skillet and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute.",
    "Add the lemon juice and wine to the pan and deglaze, scraping up any browned bits. Bring to a boil, turn heat to low and add the capers. Adjust the salt seasoning to taste.",
    "Return the swordfish to the skillet and let the fish cook for a few minutes so that it can absorb the flavors of the sauce. Sprinkle with the parsley and serve at once, garnished with parsley and lemon."
