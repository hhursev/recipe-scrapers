  "title": "Chewy Chocolate Crinkle Cookies",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder (I recommend sifting it if it is very lumpy)",
    "2 cups all-purpose flour",
    "1.5 teaspoons baking powder",
    "1/4 teaspoon salt",
    "1/3 cup butter (softened)",
    "1 1/2 cups white sugar",
    "2 teaspoons vanilla",
    "4 large eggs",
    "1/2 cup powdered sugar"
  ],
  "instructions_list": [
    "Dry ingredients",
    "Combine dry ingredients: Combine cocoa powder, flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Set aside.",
    "Wet ingredients",
    "Cream wet ingredients: Place butter, sugar and vanilla in a large mixing bowl and beat with an electric mixer until combined. Add the eggs, one at a time, and mix on medium-low speed just until combined - about 10 seconds each.",
    "Make dough",
    "Make cookie dough: Add the dry ingredients to the egg mixture and mix on low speed until incorporated.",
    "Chill cookie dough: Cover the bowl and chill the dough for at least 1 hour or up to overnight (the longer you chill, the thicker the cookies will be).",
    "Roll cookies: When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350°F. Place the powdered sugar in a medium bowl. Roll the dough into tablespoon-sized balls and cover them well with the sugar.",
    "Bake cookies: Place on a lined baking sheet with enough space between them (bake in batches) and bake for 10-15 minutes, or until spread and crackled. Cookies will still be soft, so let them cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing them to a cooling rack to cool completely."
