    "Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and gently fold until everything is well combined.",
    "Remove the hot skillet from the oven and add 2 tablespoons of butter. Add the skillet back to the oven and let melt completely. Once the butter has melted, remove the skillet from the oven and swirl the butter around until the skillet is fully coated. Pour the batter into the hot skillet.",
    "Bake the cornbread for around 25-30 minutes at 400 degrees or until a toothpick comes out clean. The center of the cornbread should be puffed and the edges golden brown.",
    "Make the Whipped Hot Honey Butter",
