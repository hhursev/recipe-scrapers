    "Spray your crockpot with non-stick spray.",
    "Rinse your uncooked pasta in a strainer and drain out all the excess water.",
    "Add your uncooked pasta to your crockpot along with your milk, cheese, mustard, garlic, salt, pepper, and cayenne. Stir everything well so all the ingredients mix together and make sure the macaroni is in the liquid as much as possible.",
    "Add your cubed butter.",
    "Cover your crock pot and turn on the low heat and cook for 1 hour. Remove the lid and stir all your ingredients before replacing the lid. Check the consistency because your dish may be done or require an additional 1-2 hours.",
    "Check your dish every half hour if it is not done and remember to stir when checking your dish.",
