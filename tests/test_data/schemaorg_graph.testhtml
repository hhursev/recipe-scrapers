                "1 1/2 cups (224g) King Arthur Gluten-Free All-Purpose Flour",
                "2 tablespoons (18g) buttermilk powder or 2 tablespoons (14g) nonfat dry milk powder",
                "1 teaspoon baking powder",
                "3/4 teaspoon salt",
                "1 teaspoon xanthan gum",
                "1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast",
                "1 tablespoon sugar or honey optional",

            "recipeInstructions": "Place the dry ingredients (except the yeast and sugar or honey, if you\u0027re using it) into a large mixing bowl; the bowl of your stand mixer is perfect. Mix until thoroughly blended., Place the sugar or honey (if you\u0027re using it), warm water, 2 tablespoons (25g) olive oil, yeast, and about 1/2 cup (78g) of the dry mixture into a small bowl. Stir to combine; a few lumps are OK. Set aside for 30 minutes or so, until the mixture is bubbly and smells yeasty., Add this mixture to the dry ingredients, and beat on medium-high speed for 4 minutes. The mixture will be thick and sticky; if you\u0027ve ever applied spackling compound to a wall, that\u0027s exactly what it\u0027ll look and feel like. Note: you must use a stand mixer or electric hand mixer to make this dough; mixing by hand doesn\u0027t do a thorough enough job., Cover the bowl, and let the dough rest for 30 minutes or so., Preheat the oven to 425Â°F., Drizzle 2 tablespoons (25g) olive oil onto the center of a baking sheet or 12\u0022 round pizza pan. Scrape the dough from the bowl onto the puddle of oil., Using your wet fingers, start at the center of the dough and work outwards, pressing it into a 12\u0022 to 14\u0022 circle., Let the dough rest, uncovered, for 15 minutes., Bake the crust for 8 to 10 minutes, just until it\u0027s set; the surface will look opaque, rather than shiny., Remove from the oven and top with whatever you like. Return to the oven to finish baking, about 10 to 15 minutes depending on the toppings you\u0027ve chosen., Remove from the oven, and serve warm.",
