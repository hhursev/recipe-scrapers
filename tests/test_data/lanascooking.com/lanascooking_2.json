    "To Roast the Turkey:",
    "If using a frozen turkey, thaw in the refrigerator allowing at least 24 hours for every 4 pounds of turkey.",
    "Approximately 1 1/2 hours before cooking, remove the turkey from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature.",
    "Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Drain any juices from the turkey and pat it dry with paper towels.",
    "Place the turkey breast side up on a rack in a roasting pan.",
    "Tuck the wings under the turkey and secure the legs with kitchen twine if needed.",
    "Rub the turkey generously with the butter. Sprinkle evenly with seasoned salt.",
    "Place the turkey in the preheated oven.",
    "About 2/3 through cooking time, check to make sure the breast and tops of the legs aren't browning too quickly. If needed, cover the turkey loosely with a tent of aluminum foil to prevent overcooking.",
    "Turkey is done when the temperature in the thigh registers 180 degrees on a meat thermometer.",
    "Remove from the oven and let stand for at least 20 minutes before carving.",
    "To Make the Gravy:",
    "Remove drippings from the turkey roasting pan and place in a medium saucepan.",
    "Using a whisk, blend the flour into the pandrippings.",
    "Whisk in the stock or broth a little at a time",
    "Place the saucepan over medium high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 5 minutes."
