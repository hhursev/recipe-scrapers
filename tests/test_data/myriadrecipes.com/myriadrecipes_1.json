  "title": "Homemade Ice Cream Sandwich",
  "ingredients": [
    "500 ml double cream",
    "375 g condensed milk (one tin)",
    "1 tsp vanilla essence",
    "75 g chocolate chips",
    "8 cookies/biscuits",
    "1 large bar of milk chocolate"
  ],
  "instructions_list": [
    "In a bowl, pour in your double cream. Using an electric whisk, whip up your double cream until thickened. If you lift up the bowl and tilt it, the cream should stay firm and still.",
    "In another bowl, pour in your condensed milk and tsp of vanilla essence. Combine the two ingredients.",
    "Gently fold your whipped cream into the condensed milk mixture until well combined.",
    "Pour in your chocolate chips and gently stir them into the mixture.",
    "Transfer the mixture into a metal tin (I used a banana loaf baking tin). Spread it out evenly and then place it into the freezer for around 6 hours.",
    "Once your ice cream is set, get your cookies ready (I got some chocolate chip biscuits from Tesco). Place a scoopful of ice cream into the center of a cookie, place another cookie on top and press down. Repeat this step and then place all of the sandwiches back into the tin and into the freezer.",
    "Meanwhile, make your chocolate dipping sauce by placing a bowl into a small saucepan of boiling water. Make sure the bowl doesn't touch the water. On medium heat, crack in the chocolate and stir until it's completely melted down.",
    "Get your ice cream sandwiches and dunk them into the chocolate sauce so that half of the biscuit is covered. Place them back into the freezer for 30 minutes and then serve up and enjoy!"
