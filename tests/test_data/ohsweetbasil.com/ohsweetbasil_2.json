  "instructions_list": [
    "Prepare the pie crust per instructions.",
    "Fold the rolled out dough over the rolling pin and unroll the dough into the 9\" pie pan without stretching. Press into pie pan and crimp edges.",
    "Lay a round of parchment paper onto the crust. Now press tin foil onto the paper so that it doesn't stick to the crust, pushing it against the edge of the crust and over the crimped edges and fill with pie weights, beans or popcorn kernels. Bake at 425 degrees for 15-20 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk together the egg wash.",
    "To keep the crust from getting soggy and make it shiny, take the pie out and brush the crust with an egg wash (including the crimped edges) and then using a fork, dock the pie crust by poking holes. Cover the crimped edges in foil and bake another 10 minutes at 425F without the parchment, foil and pie weights.",
    "Then reduce the temperature down to 375 degrees and bake until the center is golden, about 15-20 minutes.",
    "For the Banana Infusion",
    "Add 1 tablespoon of butter to a medium pot. Add the sliced bananas and stir to coat in butter. Cook for about 2 minutes or until softened. Add the whole milk and heavy cream, stirring gently.",
    "Cook until the mixture comes to a boil and then cook for 30 seconds. Turn off the heat and move off of the burner, adding a lid and allow to sit for 50 minutes.",
    "For the Filling",
    "In a large bowl, add the egg yolks, sugar and salt, whisking aggressively to combine until it looks a pale yellow. Add the EZ gel and whisk again.",
    "Using a colander, strain the hot milk into the eggs without pressing on the bananas and then discard the bananas. Whisk the eggs and milk together and then dump everything into a clean pot over medium heat and continue whisking.",
    "Cook, whisking continually until 180 degrees and thickened into a pudding, about 6 minutes.",
    "Remove from heat and add vanilla and butter and stir until butter is all melted.",
    "Place plastic wrap over the bowl and onto the pudding to prevent a skin from forming and chill to bring down to room temperature, about 2 hours.",
    "Assembly",
    "Spread a layer of the pudding onto the bottom to help prevent brown bananas. Slice 3-4 Bananas onto the pudding. Fill with remaining filling and smooth out all over the crust being sure to seal around the edges, cover and refrigerate at least 5 hours, or up to overnight. Top with fresh whipped cream or stabilized whipped cream and extra bananas and nilla wafer crumbs and serve!"
