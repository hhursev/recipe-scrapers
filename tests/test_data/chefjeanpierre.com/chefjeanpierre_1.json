    "The Chef does in two separate pots in the video to save some time but you can do it all in one pot. This is how….",
    "In a Dutch oven, heat clarified butter or the olive oil when hot, add the bacon. Cook at low heat for a few minutes to release some of the fat from the bacon. Add as many meat cubes as you can without crowding (if the skillet is too crowded, the meat won't brown properly) Brown the meat well on all sides, remove each batch as it browns and set them aside. Add the onions and cook them until golden brown. It may be necessary to add a little Clarified butter or Butter olive oil.",
    "When all the onions are golden brown add the mushrooms, add salt on top of the mushrooms and cook until they have release most of their water. Add the carrots, reserved beef cubes, garlic and when fragrant, add the wine, bring to boil and let reduce by half. This could take about 3 to 5 minutes depending on your pot and your heat source. Add the potatoes, fresh thyme and salt and pepper to taste.",
    "To thicken, use the chef’s technique with the flour or if you have use a roux and thicken to your liking. Add half of the chopped parsley, bring to boil, reduce to VERY LOW heat, cook for about 2 ½ to 3 hours or until the beef is fork tender.",
    "When finished, add the Cognac, the rest of the chopped parsley and adjust salt and pepper to your liking."
