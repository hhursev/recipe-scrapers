    "Prepare the duck by trimming excess skin, removing giblets, and patting it dry. Poke small holes in the skin to help render fat during cooking. Dry-brine the duck by generously salting the skin and inside cavity, then place it uncovered in the refrigerator for 24 hours.",
    "While the duck brines, prepare the duck stock. In a large pot, combine chopped duck neck, wings, onion, carrots, celery, leek, star anise, garlic, and peppercorns. Add water to cover, bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 3-4 hours. Strain the stock and set reserve.",
    "Preheat Oven to 375°F (190°C)",
    "Rinse the duck in ice water to remove excess salt, pat it dry, and score the skin without cutting into the meat. Place it in a roasting pan or a drying rack on a bed of onion. Roast for 2 hours or until the internal temperature reaches 155°F (68°C).",
    "While the duck roasts, make the glaze. Combine honey, soy sauce, and star anise in a small saucepan and simmer until slightly thickened. Brush the glaze over the duck during the last 10 minutes of roasting and increase the oven temperature to 500°F (260°C) to achieve a golden brown finish.",
    "For the Orange Sauce, combine sugar and vinegar in a saucepan over medium heat to create a caramel. Carefully add the duck stock, orange juices, and orange zest. Simmer until reduced, then thicken with cornstarch slurry. Stir in butter off heat until smooth and glossy.",
    "Carve the duck by removing the legs and slicing the breast meat. Serve with orange sauce drizzled on top or on the side. Garnish with orange segments if desired."
