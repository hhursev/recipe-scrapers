Add one Oreo cookie into each paper cup. Set aside.\nAdd softened cream cheese and sugar to a medium mixing bowl. Beat on medium speed using a hand mixer.\nThen add vanilla and eggs. Mixing well until smooth without lumps.\nAdd sour cream, mix until combined. Tap bowl against your countertop a few times to release any large air bubbles.\nStir in chopped cookies, and mix generally using a spatula. (Be careful not to crush oreos into smaller crumbs.)\nSpoon the batter on top of the oreo, filling each to almost the top. Note that cheesecake won't rise as much as a regular cupcake.\nPlace in the lower third of the oven and bake for about 20-25 minutes until the edges just start to turn brown. Note that classic cheesecake is supposed to look pale, so you're not looking for golden brown.\nRemove from oven and transfer to cooling racks.\nChill in the fridge for 4 hours or overnight. Serve and enjoy! (You can store them in the fridge for up to 5 days.)",
