They were DELICIOUS. Made some substitutions which allowed me to finish a bunch of almost-empty nut butters, so I did mostly tahini, some Trader Joes mixed nut butter, and a bit of peanut butter. I also didn't have coconut sugar so I used raw turbinado sugar since it has a similar consistency. One small mistake I made was that I accidentally used corn starch instead of baking powder (whoops, both cans looked the same!), so they may not have risen as much as they would have, but still tasted incredible. Next time I plan on adding walnuts too :)"},{"@type":"Review","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sophia E"},"datePublished":"2020-04-13","reviewBody":"Made these brownies during quarantine; my boyfriend and I ate them in 2 days (that says it all right?!)

But really&#8230;these brownies are about to change your brownie eating lifestyle for the better.</p><h2>The most FUDGEY brownies that are flourless, nut-free, paleo and they are SO easy to bake.</h2><p>I constantly find myself craving brownies lately. All day, everyday, ya girl just wants a thick brownie that melts in my mouth when it is warmed up. You know when the chocolate is oozing out and it&#8217;s almost too fudgey to even stay together? Ya, that kind of brownie is what we are baking today.</p><p>Now don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love all my brownie recipes. Especially those <a href="https://rachlmansfield.com/gluten-free-chocolate-chip-cookie-brownies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chocolate chip cookie brownies</a>. Butt these are next level.</p><p>Probably because they require basically no ingredients (but really only 6 key ingredients are needed) and because my favorite dark chocolate is involved.</p><div class='mailmunch-forms-in-post-middle' style='display: none !important;'></div><p>Hu Kitchen Dark Chocolate Gems! Now there is a reason that they call these bad boys gems. They live up to the name too. And let me tell you &#8211; you won&#8217;t even realize they have no refined sugar in them. They are the healthiest baking and snacking chocolate you could imagine. Sweetened with coconut sugar. Made with all organic ingredients (you know the drill with my Hu fam). Plus the gems melt so perfectly in these brownies, it is basically like eating a lava cake.</p><p>Oh and don&#8217;t forget to sprinkle some on top after the brownies bake!<span id="more-25933"></span></p><h2>Key ingredients needed to bake these flourless brownies:</h2><ol><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015WU3X5Q/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rachlmansfi01-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B015WU3X5Q&amp;linkId=746f4a1dfbfd7f266a1d7d2ea7e146b5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Creamy tahini.</a> I use tahini in these brownies to make them nut-free and because it is more of a subtle flavored nut/seed butter.

They were DELICIOUS. Made some substitutions which allowed me to finish a bunch of almost-empty nut butters, so I did mostly tahini, some Trader Joes mixed nut butter, and a bit of peanut butter. I also didn&#8217;t have coconut sugar so I used raw turbinado sugar since it has a similar consistency. One small mistake I made was that I accidentally used corn starch instead of baking powder (whoops, both cans looked the same!), so they may not have risen as much as they would have, but still tasted incredible.
