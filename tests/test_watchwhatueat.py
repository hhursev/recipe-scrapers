Optionally, broil it 3-4 min in the oven to get a nice crust.\nTurn on the saute mode in the Instant Pot. Add flour to the gravy base and blend everything using a hand blender until it gets to a smooth consistency. Add salt and pepper according to taste.\nCook the gravy for 3-4 min and serve warm with the cooked cauliflower.",
