Continue to cook, stirring constantly, until eggs are just cooked through but not yet browned, about 1 additional minute. Transfer eggs to the small bowl and set aside.\nAdd\nReturn the skillet to the heat, and increase the heat to high. Let the skillet warm until it is nice and hot, about 1 minute. Add the canola oil, and swirl to coat. Add the diced bell pepper, and cook until it is crisp-tender, about 4 minutes.\nBrown\nAdd the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons butter, peas and carrots, and edamame. Cook, stirring constantly, for 30 seconds. Stir in the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds (do not let the garlic burn!).\nCook\nAdd the brown rice and the oyster sauce mixture. Continue cooking, stirring constantly and breaking up any remaining rice clumps, until the mixture is heated through, about 3 minutes.\nAdd reserved eggs and green onions. Cook and stir until the mixture is completely heated through, about 1 minute more. Enjoy immediately with a sprinkle of red pepper flakes or dash of hot sauce and additional soy sauce as desired."
