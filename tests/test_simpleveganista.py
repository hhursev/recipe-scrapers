Transfer to a small plate lined with a paper napkin to soak up excess oil.\nSaute\nIn a large pan, heat oil/water over medium-high heat, add the onion, garlic, celery, and bell peppers, saute for 5 minutes. Add the smoked paprika, thyme, oregano, and cayenne, and saute for 1 minute more.\nSimmer\nAdd the crushed tomatoes, rice, bay leaves, and broth, bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover askew, and simmer on low for 20 – 25 minutes, stirring every 7 minutes or so to keep the rice from sticking to the bottom of the pan. In the last 5 minutes, add the beans and/or sausage and continue to cook until warmed through. Remove bay leaves, season with salt and pepper.\nServe\nSpoon into serving bowls and top with garnish of choice.\nServes 6 – 8\nStore\nLeftovers can be stored for up to 5 days in the refrigerator.
